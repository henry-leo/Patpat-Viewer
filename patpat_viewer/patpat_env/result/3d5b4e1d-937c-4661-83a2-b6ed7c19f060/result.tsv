TAp63-regulated microRNAs suppress cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma	TAp63 is a transcription factor belonging to the p53 family with important tumor suppressive functions. We show that TAp63-/- mice exhibit an increased susceptibility to UVR-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC). These tumors showed global disruption of miRNA and mRNA expression when compared to tumors arising in wild-type mice. A comparison to similarly sequenced human cuSCC tumors identified miR-30c-2* and miR-497 as being significantly underexpressed in cuSCC. Reintroduction of these miRNAs significantly inhibited the growth of cuSCC cell lines and xenografts. Proteomic profiling of cells transfected with either miRNA showed significant downregulation of proteins related to cell cycle progression and mitosis. A cross-platform comparison of the RNAseq and proteomics signatures identified 7 downregulated proteins, which are also frequently overexpressed in both mouse and human cuSCC. Knockdown of AURKA, KIF18B, PKMYT1, and ORC1 in cuSCC cell lines suppressed tumor cell proliferation and induced cell death. Additionally, we found that an investigational, oral, selective inhibitor of AURKA suppressed cuSCC cell growth and induced cell death, and showed anti-tumor effects in vivo. Our data establishes TAp63 as an essential regulator of miRNA expression during skin carcinogenesis and reveals a novel network of miRNAs and mRNAs, which include potential targets for therapeutic intervention.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014261
Proteomics at large: Discovery and replication of plasma proteomic biomarkers in independent cohorts - Overweight and obese patients of the Weight Management Clinical program of The Ottawa Hospital	Holistic human proteome maps are expected to complement comprehensive profile assessment of health and disease phenotypes. However, methodologies to analyze proteomes in human tissue or body fluid samples at relevant scale and performance are still limited in clinical research. Their deployment and demonstration in large enough human populations are even sparser. In the present study, we have characterized and compared the plasma proteomes of two large independent cohorts of obese and overweight individuals using shotgun MS-based proteomics. One cohort comes from a Canadian single-center clinical weight management program while the other one belongs to a multicenter pan-European weight loss study (i.e., the DiOGenes study for which MS proteomic data have been already deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD005216).  The MS proteomic data deposited herein corresponds to the cohort coming from the Weight Management Clinical program of The Ottawa Hospital.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009350

A systematic evaluation of the use of human plasma and serum for mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics - commercial pooled samples	Over the last two decades, EDTA-plasma has been used as the preferred sample matrix for human blood proteomic profiling. Serum has also been employed widely. Only a few studies have assessed the difference and relevance of the proteome profiles obtained from plasma samples, such as EDTA-plasma or lithium-heparin-plasma, and serum. A complete evaluation of the use of EDTA-plasma, heparin-plasma, and serum would greatly expand the comprehensiveness of shotgun proteomics of blood samples. In this study, we evaluated the use of heparin-plasma with respect to EDTA-plasma and serum to profile blood proteomes using a scalable automated proteomic pipeline (ASAP2). The use of plasma and serum for mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics was tested with commercial pooled samples. The proteome coverage consistency and the quantitative performance were compared.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007846
An adaptive pipeline to maximize isobaric tagging data in large-scale MS-based proteomics	Isobaric tagging is a method of choice in Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics for comparing multiple conditions at a time. Despite its multiplexing capabilities, when multiple experiments are merged for comparison in large sample-size studies, some drawbacks appears, due to the presence of missing values, which result from the stochastic nature of the Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode. Another indirect cause of data incompleteness might derive from the proteomic-typical data processing workflow that first identifies proteins in individual experiments and then only quantifies those identified proteins, leaving a large number of unmatched spectra with quantitative information unexploited.  Inspired by untargeted metabolomic and label-free proteomic workflows, we developed a quantification-driven bioinformatic pipeline (Quantify then Identify – QtI) that optimizes the processing of isobaric Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) data from large-scale studies. This pipeline includes innovative modules, such as the Peptide Match Rescue (PMR) and the Optimized Post-Translational Modification (OPTM) and outperforms a classical benchmark workflow in terms of quantification and identification rates, significantly reducing missing data while preserving unmatched features for quantitative comparison. The number of unexploited tandem mass spectra was reduced by 77% and 62% for two human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma datasets, respectively.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008029
Chromatin isolation for mass spectrometry	The histone acetyl-reader BRD4 is an important regulator of chromatin structure and transcription, yet factors modulating its activity have remained elusive. Here we describe two complementary screens for genetic and physical interactors of BRD4, which converge on the folate pathway enzyme MTHFD1. We show that a fraction of MTHFD1 resides in the nucleus, where it is recruited to distinct genomic loci by direct interaction with BRD4. Inhibition of either BRD4 or MTHFD1 results in similar changes in nuclear metabolite composition and gene expression, and pharmacologic inhibitors of the two pathways synergize to impair cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Our finding that MTHFD1 and other metabolic enzymes are chromatin-associated suggests a direct role for nuclear metabolism in the control of gene expression.  BRD4 is an important chromatin regulator with roles in gene regulation, DNA damage, cell proliferation and cancer progression1-4. The protein is recruited to distinct genomic loci by the interaction of its tandem bromodomains with acetylated lysines on histones and other nuclear proteins5. There, BRD4 acts as a transcriptional activator by P-TEFb-mediated stimulation of transcriptional elongation6. The activating function of BRD4 on key driver oncogenes like MYC have made this epigenetic enzyme an important therapeutic target in both BRD4 translocated and BRD4 wild-type cancers3,7-12, and at least seven bromodomain inhibitors have reached the clinical stage13. Genome-wide studies have identified the role of BRD4-induced epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer cell resistance14, and factors defining BRD4 inhibitor response15,16. However, despite its clinical importance and the broad role of BRD4 in chromatin organization, surprisingly little is known about factors that are directly required for BRD4 function. To systematically expand the list of known BRD4 interactors5 and to characterize proteins directly required for BRD4 function, we developed a strategy of two complementary screens for genetic and physical partners of BRD4. The two approaches converge on a single factor, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1). Our description of a transcriptional role for this C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase highlights a direct connection between nuclear folate metabolism and cancer regulation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013090
Identification of Missing Proteins in the Phosphoproteome of Kidney Cancer	Finding missing proteins (MPs) has been one of the critical missions of Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) since 2012, twenty-five research teams from seventeen countries have been trying to search adequate and accurate evidence for MPs through various biochemical strategies. In our previous study, we found that phosphoproteomics is one pleasant means to catch low-abundance and membrane proteins which are phosphorylated. Therefore, we speculate it may be an available approach for MPs detection. In this study, kidney cancer and adjacent tissues were used for phosphoproteomics research, we totally identified 8962 proteins including 6415 phosphoproteins, and 44728 phosphosites, of which 10266 were unreported previously. Interestingly, a total of 75 MPs were found, after rigorous screening and manual checking, 26 MPs were ranked as confident MPs by the verification with the synthesized peptides and a stringent manual check of their MS2 spectra, among which 14 MPs were phosphorylated. Functional analysis for 26 MPs revealed that 16 MPs were found to be membrane proteins, 7 MPs were testis-enriched and 1 MPs were kidney-specific. Therefore we concluded that phosphoproteomics is a promising approach in digging MPs for C-HPP studies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006482
Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - primary mammary fibroblasts treated with IL1-beta	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001328

Sex estimation of human remains using the results of tooth enamel peptidomic analyses, LC-MSMS	Sex of individuals, estimated on human remains, is important information in anthropological, archaeological and forensic researches. In forensic anthropology, this is one of the key points for identifying a person. In archeology and paleoanthropology, information about sex is important for reconstructing the social and biological structure of a group, lifestyle, and for modeling demographic and growth processes in the past. Sex estimation of adult individuals is possible according to morphological criteria when metric and descriptive features are used. In case of poor preservation of the adult skeletons, as well as on children's remains, sex estimation by morphological criteria has some limitations. Therefore regular attempts are made to attract alternative methods for sexing human remains. As one of such methods a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of tooth enamel peptides can be used. The result of this analysis is the identification of certain fragments of amelogenins - the main structural proteins of the organic matrix of tooth enamel, which make up more than 90% of its protein content. Amelogenin genes are located on both the X- and Y-chromosomes and the products of these genes have structural differences that allow them to be differentiated from each other. In the process of maturation of tooth enamel, its protein matrix undergoes proteolytic degradation, as a result enamel already contains proteins in the form of their peptide fragments. Reliable and reproducible detection of unique peptide fragments of amelogenins encoded on the X- and Y-chromosomes in human enamel will make it possible to estimate sex of human remains. The work presents a peptidomic analysis of tooth enamel using chromatography-mass spectrometry. Experiments were carried out on a series of teeth of various archaeological data, tafonomic condition of crown and different biological generations of teeth (deciduous and permanent ones).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017965

Large scale proteomics of cholesteatoma	The study describes comprehensive proteomics data of the cholesteatoma disease. Cholesteatoma is a serious and destructive growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear, with a poorly understood etiopathogenesis. The large scale proteomics approach used in this study highly expands our molecular knowledge of cholesteatoma and implicates several biological functions in its pathology. Human samples of cholesteatoma, neck of cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane, external auditory canal skin, and middle ear mucosa were analyzed. Approximately two thousand unique proteins were identified by label-free nanoLC-MS/MS proteomics.        The protein and peptide identification data were obtained by Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, version 1.3.0.339) processing of LTQ Orbitrap raw files using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Sciences, version 2.4.0). To yield comprehensive proteome data the tissue biopsy was separated into ten protein fractions, which were MS analysed separately, and the resulting MS files were subsequently merged in the database analysis. Precursor mass tolerance was 5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was 0.5 Da. Dynamic Modification was Oxidation (M) and Static Modification was Carbamidomethyl (C); annotated in the PRIDE files as mass deviations (e g for double charged peptides m/z deviation of approximately 8.00 and 28.51 for modification of Met and Cys, respectively). FASTA file was SwissProt_2012_03.fasta (containing 20,255 Homo sapiens sequences). MudPit scoring was applied, and up to two missed trypsin cleavages were accepted. Peptide cut off Score was 10 and protein relevance threshold was 20.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000457

Affinity Purification experiments for 24 human Bromodomain proteins involved in DNA repair and genome integrity (part 1 of 2).	Bromodomain proteins (BRD) are key chromatin regulators of genome function and stability, as well as therapeutic targets in cancer. In our associated publication (doi:10.1101/gad.331231.119) we systematically delineate the contribution of human BRD proteins for genome stability and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair using cell-based assays and proteomic interaction network analysis. These AP-MS experiments were performed in order to construct a protein interaction network for the 24 BRDs we identified as promoters of DNA repair and/or genome integrity: BAZ1B, BRD1, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRD8, BRD9, BRPF3, BRWD3, CECR2, EP300, GCN5/KAT2A, PCAF/KAT2B, PHIP, SMARCA2, SP100, SP110, SP140, TAF1, TRIM24, TRIM28, TRIM33, TRIM66, ZMYND8. In combination with cell based assays, we identified a BRD-reader function of PCAF that bound TIP60-mediated histone acetylations at DSBs to recruit a DUB complex to deubiquitylate histone H2BK120, to allow direct acetylation by PCAF and repair of DSBs by homologous recombination. We also discovered the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4, as negative regulators of transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrid (R-Loop) as inhibition of BRD2 or BRD4 increased R-loop formation, which generated DSBs. These breaks were reliant on Topoisomerase II and BRD2 directly bound and activated Topoisomerase I, a known restrainer of R-loops. Thus, comprehensive interactome and functional profiling of BRD proteins revealed new homologous recombination and genome stability pathways, providing a strategy to understand genome maintenance by BRD proteins and the effects of their pharmacological inhibition. This accession provides AP-MS experiment files for the following subset of 18 BRDs: BAZ1B, BRD1, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRD8, BRPF3, BRWD3, CECR2, PHIP, SMARCA2, SP100, SP110, TAF1, TRIM24, TRIM33, TRIM66, ZMYND8, as well as their associated controls (Input, Mock, and SBP-tagged NLS).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016700

SNW1 is required for sister chromatid cohesion	Although splicing is essential for the expression of most eukaryotic genes, inactivation of splicing factors causes specific defects in mitosis. The molecular cause of this defect is unknown. Here we show that the spliceosome subunits SNW1 and PRPF8 are essential for sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that SNW1 or PRPF8 depletion affects the splicing of specific introns in a subset of pre-mRNAs, including pre-mRNAs encoding the cohesion protein sororin and the APC/C subunit APC2. SNW1 depletion causes cohesion defects predominantly by reducing sororin levels, which causes destabilisation of cohesin on DNA. SNW1 depletion also reduces APC/C activity and contributes to cohesion defects indirectly by delaying mitosis and causing ‘cohesion fatigue’. Simultaneous expression of sororin and APC2 from intron-less cDNAs restores cohesion in SNW1 depleted cells. These results indicate that the spliceosome is required for mitosis because it enables expression of genes essential for cohesion. Our transcriptome-wide identification of retained introns in SNW1 and PRPF8 depleted cells may help to understand the aetiology of diseases associated with splicing defects, such as retinosa pigmentosum and cancer.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001249
An optimised method for CSF extracellular vesicle extraction and comparative proteomic analysis	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and offer a source of biomarkers for diagnostic, stratification and therapeutic monitoring purposes.  A major limitation in the development of specific biomarkers based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) EVs is the difficulty of extracting sufficient quantities of vesicles for discovery techniques such as proteomics.  This study describes a novel application of a size-based extraction technique for CSF EVs using ultrafiltration liquid chromatography (UFLC), and comparison with the gold-standard ultracentrifugation (UC) method.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006353
Mechanism of 17-β Estradiol Stimulated Integration of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Heart Tissue	Scarcity of gender specific donor hearts highlights the importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic tool for heart repair. However, inefficient incorporation, retention, and activity of MSCs in cardiac tissue remains an obstacle. Since surge in follicular estradiol (μmolar-range) triggers tissue remodeling (e.g. ovulation) and estradiol exerts beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system, we hypothesized that estradiol may promote/improve MSC-mediated cardiac repair processes. Methods: Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs were used, to assess the effects of estradiol on their proliferation, directed-migration and engraftment in murine heart slices, ex vivo. Results: MSCs expressed estrogen receptors (ERs) α and β, and estradiol promoted MSC proliferation (measured using xCELLigence real-time cell-impedance system and DNA-quantification). Estradiol up-regulated mRNA (qRT-PCR) and protein expression (western blotting) of ERα, ERβ, EMMPRIN, and MMP-9, yet down-regulated MMP-2 expression. In MSCs estradiol, up-regulated mRNA expression of VEGF-A, VCAM-1, and angiogenin, and stimulated NO production via ER. Proteomic analysis revealed that in MSCs estradiol up-regulated 47 proteins, down-regulated 7 proteins, and increased the expression of key biochemical components/pathways involved in tissue repair. In MSCs co-cultured with murine heart-slices, estradiol significantly induced MSC migration in an ER-dependent fashion (and preferentially via ERα) and significantly increased the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, angiogenin and VEGF. Conclusion: Estradiol facilitates the integration/engraftment of MSCs into heart slices by promoting MSC proliferation and migration and these beneficial effects are mediated via increases in molecules/pathways involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. Priming of MSCs with estradiol may enhance their ability to repair/regenerate cardiac tissue in women.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011742

Single Cell Immuno-laser Microdissection Coupled to Label-free Proteomics to Reveal the Proteotypes of Human Brain Cells After Ischemia	Cerebral ischemia entails rapid tissue damage in the affected brain area causing devastating neurological disorders. The use of biomarkers in stroke might have a major impact in patients’ management, both in the diagnosis and the prognosis. Thus, the analysis of the brain proteome is a straightforward approach for the identification of specific biomarkers and for the detection of potential new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection or recovery strategies.  In this study, post-mortem brain slices from ischemic stroke patients were obtained corresponding to infarcted (IC) and contralateral (CL) areas. By means of laser microdissection, neurons and blood brain barrier structures (BBB) were isolated and analyzed in a label-free manner on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro MS following a gas phase fractionation approach for precursor ion selection. Ninety one proteins were identified only in neurons, 261 proteins only in BBB and 260 proteins in both cell types (peptides≥2). Gene ontology analyses revealed the alteration of metabolic processes after brain ischemia and also changes regarding catalytic activity and binding. Antioxidant activity and enzyme regulator activity appeared as cell-specific altered molecular functions. A total of 25 proteins showing p<0.05 and fold-change>|2| between IC and CL areas were considered significant in this study: 11 in neurons, 11 in BBB and 3 in both cell types. Twelve of these proteins were selected as candidates and analyzed by immunohistochemistry in independent brains. The MS findings were verified for neuronal SAHH2 and SRSF1 and for EAA2 in both cell types. In addition, SAHH2 showed its potential as prognostic biomarker when analyzed early in plasma of ischemic stroke patients.  Therefore, our results will contribute to increase the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of ischemic stroke pathology and launch new proteins that might represent putative biomarkers of brain ischemia or therapeutic targets.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003519
Relief Food Subsistence Revealed by Microparticle and Proteomics Analyses of Dental Calculus From Victims of the Great Irish Famine	Food and diet were class markers in nineteenth-century Ireland, which became evident as nearly one million people, primarily the poor and destitute, died as a consequence of the notorious Great Famine of 1845–1852. Famine took hold after a blight (Phytophthora infestans) destroyed the only means of subsistence—the potato crop—for a significant proportion of the population. This study seeks to elucidate the variability of diet in mid-nineteenth-century Ireland through microparticle and proteomic analysis of human dental calculus samples (n = 42) from victims of the Famine. The sample derives from remains of people who died between August 1847 and March 1851 while receiving poor relief as inmates in the union workhouse in the city of Kilkenny (52°39’N, -7°15’W). The results corroborate the historical accounts of food provisions before and during the Famine, with evidence of corn (maize), potato and cereal starch granules from the microparticle analysis and milk proteins from the proteomic analysis. Unexpectedly, there is also evidence of egg proteins—a food source generally reserved only for export and the better-off social classes—which highlights the variability of the Famine experience for those who died. Through historical contextualisation, this study shows how the notoriously monotonous potato diet of the nineteenth-century Irish poor was supplemented by other foodstuffs on an opportunistic basis. While the Great Irish Famine was one of the worst subsistence crises in history, it was foremost a social disaster induced by the lack of access to food and not the lack of food availability.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015002
Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - secreted proteins of inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001420

Novel surface functionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles with engineered cellular uptake as a means for intracellular omics	Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPMNPs) are appealing for use in organelle isolation strategies. Yet, this potential remains largely unexplored because thus far research has focused on either physicochemical design or on their application in micron-sized beads. For their use in life sciences, the biocompatibility of SPMNPs goes beyond their chemical composition and shape, and features like their size and more importantly their surface properties are becoming more important to exploit extra- and intracellular interactions. Here we introduce thermal decomposition to manufacture iron oxide based SPMNPs (Ø10nm) and demonstrate how different surface functionalizations can lead to different types of cellular interactions.  Cationic aminolipid-coated SPMNPs reside surprisingly strong at the outer cell surface. In contrast, anionic dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated SPMNPs are efficiently internalized and accumulate in a time-dependent manner in endosomal and lysosomal populations. These features allowed us to establish a standardized magnetic isolation procedure to selectively isolate plasma membranes and intracellular late endosomes/lysosomes with high yields and purities as consolidated by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Subsequent quantitative and qualitative proteome analysis underpins the overall high enrichment for hydrophobic (membrane) proteins as well as plasma membrane and lysosomal constituents in the respective purified fractions. This nano based technology provides therefore a breakthrough in the field of subcellular ‘omics’ as it allows the identification of subtle alterations in the biomolecular composition of different SPMNP-isolated compartments that would be otherwise not detected in total cell or tissue analysis.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001225
Proteome profiling of human myoblastic RCMH cell line	The study aimed to comprehensively characterize human myoblastic cell line RCMH using using electron microscopic and proteomic approaches. Myoblastic cell lines can be useful to investigate the complex biochemical changes occuring under different conditions that reflect the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of muscle. So far, there are no suitable in vitro models of human muscle origin to study a variety of muscle related processes including responses to mechanical stress, EC-coupling and (ER-associated) myopathic disorders. Therefore, we characterized the human immortal myoblastic cell line RCMH and the results suggest RCMH as a suitable in vitro model for investigating human muscle related processes and disorders.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001974
Discovery of new cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for meningitis in children C4PR_LIV	Bacterial meningitis is usually fatal without treatment and prompt and accurate diagnosis coupled with the timely administration of parenteral antibiotics, are necessary in order to save lives.

The objective of our project is to define specific protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection which could lead to the development of assays or point-of-care devices to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, and guide the clinicians in the treatment and prognosis of children with bacterial meningitis. The associated research paper is in preparation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000764
Identification of novel biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma - LC-MS Part	The aim of this study was the identification of biomarkers for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). CCC is a primary cancer which arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is characterised by high mortality rates due to its late clinical presentation and limited treatment options. Tumorous tissue and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue from eight CCC patients were analysed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and by mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. After data analysis and statistical evaluation of the proteins which were found to be differentially regulated between the two experimental groups (fold change ≥ 1.5; p-value ≤ 0.05), 15 candidate proteins were chosen for verification by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 14 patients. This confirmed the significant up-regulation of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1), gelsolin (GSN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and tax1-binding protein 3 (Tax1BP3) in tumorous cholangiocytes when compared to normal hepatocytes, whereas fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT) were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, STIP1 and SFN were able to differentiate between CCC tumour cells and non-tumorous cholangiocytes with a sensitivity of 100% and 86%, respectively and a specificity of 100% in both cases. We therefore conclude that these proteins should be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CCC in an immunohistochemical application. Additional experiments addressing the validation of these novel biomarker candidates are being performed.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000534
N-Linked Glycoprotein Profiles of Human Breast Claudin-Low Malignant Cell Lines	Secreted proteins and transmembrane proteins with extracellular domains are frequently glycosylated; this group of proteins includes those that participate in the various intercellular junctions and signaling pathways of an epithelium.  In this study we characterized the differences in glycoprotein expression between claudin-low and other breast cell lines using a dataset of 26 breast cell lines in which the glycoproteins were identified and quantitated by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry.  Our goals are to characterize the glycoproteome of a set of claudin-low lines, compare them to basal, luminal and non-malignant cells and to identify drugs that may be especially effective on these cell lines. These five claudin-low malignant breast cells (BT549, HS578T, MDAMB157, MDAMB231 and MDAMB436) data are a part of 26 breast cell lines we analyzed.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005292
Changes in the membrane proteome of exosomes released from human macrophages after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	One of the greatest obstacles to eliminating TB is the lack of predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. Exosomes are a promising alternative source of biomarkers for TB since they can carry mycobacterial antigens. We hypothesize that exosomes from Mtb-infected macrophages exhibit a characteristic selection of human protein that can be evaluated as TB biomarkers. We looked for the localization—exosomal membrane or lumen—of the differentially abundant proteins. Exosomes were obtained from THP-1-derived macrophages (Mtb infected and uninfected controls). The exosome population was validated by nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. The protein composition of exosomes was evaluated by tandem mass spectrometry. Differences in protein composition and abundances between exosomes from infected and control cells were evaluated by t-test the proteomics findings were confirmed by western blot. Using a biotinylation strategy we verified the protein localization. Forty-seven proteins were significantly more abundant in exosomes from Mtb-infected cells, 66% were predicted to be membrane associated. The biotinylation pattern confirmed the membrane-association of some of these proteins.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004062
Absolute Quantification of 10 Centrosomal Proteins	Centrioles are essential for the formation of centrosomes and cilia. While numerical and/or structural centrosomes aberrations are implicated in cancer, mutations in centriolar and centrosomal proteins are genetically linked to ciliopathies, microcephaly and dwarfism. The evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying centrosome biogenesis are centered on a set of key proteins, including Plk4, Sas-6 and STIL, whose exact levels are critical to ensure accurate reproduction of centrioles during cell cycle progression. However, neither the intracellular levels of centrosomal proteins nor their stoichiometry within centrosomes are presently known. Here we have used two complementary approaches, targeted proteomics and EGFP-tagging of centrosomal proteins at endogenous loci, to measure protein abundance in cultured human cells and purified centrosomes. Our results provide a first assessment of the absolute and relative amounts of major components of the human centrosome. This quantitative information makes several predictions that will guide future mechanistic and structural studies on the assembly and function of this important organelle.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003927

Preterm birth CVF proteomics discovery	Preterm birth, defined as birth <37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. In the United States, approximately 12% of all births are preterm.1 Despite decades of research, there has been little progress in developing effective interventions to prevent preterm birth. In fact, the rate of preterm birth has increased slightly over the last several decades.2 The ultimate goal of the Genomic and Proteomic Network for Preterm Birth Research (GPN-PBR) is to identify possible biomarkers that could predict the susceptibility to spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) as well as to shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in its etiologies. Understanding those mechanisms will help us predict SPTB and may facilitate the introduction of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001268
Amniocyte lysate proteome -  Quantitative proteomic analysis of amniocytes reveals potentially dysregulated molecular networks in Down syndrome	Down syndrome (DS), caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, affects 1 in 750 live births and is characterised by cognitive impairment and a constellation of congenital defects. Currently, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis and no direct genotype-phenotype relationship has yet been confirmed. Since DS amniocytes are expected to have a distinct biological behaviour compared to normal amniocytes, we hypothesise that relative quantification of proteins produced from trisomy and euploid (chromosomally normal) amniocytes will reveal dysregulated molecular pathways. Chromosomally normal- and Trisomy 21-amniocytes were quantitatively analyzed by using Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Cell culture and tandem mass spectrometry. The most extensive proteome of amniocytes and amniotic fluid has been generated and differentially expressed proteins from amniocytes with Trisomy 21 revealed molecular pathways that seem to be most significantly affected by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Mass spectra were analyzed using Mascot (version 2.2, Matrix Science), executing a spectral search against a concatenated International Protein Index (IPI) human protein database (version 3.54 containing 39,925 entries) and a decoy database. Parameters included: trypsin enzyme specificity, SILAC double measurements of Lys6 and Arg8, 1 missed cleavage, minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids, minimum of 1 unique peptide, top 6 MS/MS peaks per 100 Da, peptide mass tolerance of 20 ppm for precursor ion and MS/MS tolerance of 0.5 Da. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation for variable modifications and cysteine caramidomethylation for fixed modification. All entries were filtered using a false positive rate of 1% both at the peptide and protein levels, and false positives were removed. Quantification via normalised H/L ratios was based on minimum of 3 peptide ratio counts. Protein group entries with a normalised ratio significance B score of =<  0.05 or significance A score of =<  0.05 were retained for further analysis.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000385
Proteomic analysis of Kveim reagent identifies targets of cellular immunity in sarcoidosis	Kveim-reagent (Kv) skin testing was a historical method of diagnosing sarcoidosis. Intradermal injection of treated sarcoidosis spleen tissue resulted in a granuloma response at injection site by 4-6 weeks. Previous work indicates proteins as the possible trigger of this reaction.

Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - nuclear proteins of CLL cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006589

Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - nuclear proteins of inflammatory stimulated fibroblasts	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003415

Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - secreted proteins of untreated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001417

Quantitative Proteomics Benchmark Dataset to evaluate label-free quantitative methods- LC/Orbitrap Fusion MS analysis of E coli proteomes spiked-in Human proteins at 5 different levels (N=20)	To unbiasedly evaluate the quantitative performance of different quantitative methods, and compare different  popular proteomics data processing workflows, we prepared a benchmark dataset where the various levels of spikeed-in E. Coli proteome that true fold change (i.e. 1 fold, 1.5 fold, 2 fold, 2.5 fold and 3 fold) and true identities of positives/negatives (i.e. E.Coli proteins are true positives while Human proteins are  true negatives) are  known. To best mimic the proteomics application in comparison of multiple replicates, each fold change group contains 4 replicates, so there are 20 LC-MS/MS analysis in this benchmark dataset. To our knowledge, this spike-in benchmark dataset is largest-scale ever that encompasses 5 different spike level, >500 true positive proteins, and >3000 true negative proteins (2peptide criteria, 1% protein FDR), with a wide concentration dynamic range.  The dataset is ideal to test quantitative accuracy, precision, false-positive biomarker discovery and missing data level.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003881

Multiple protease based human phosphopeptide atlas	Site-specific phospho-antibodies are commonly used to study these changes, however only a limited number of good antibodies is available, covering just a few signaling nodes in important pathways. It is highly unlikely that specific antibodies, covering the more than hundred thousands of estimated phosphosites in human cells, will become available soon. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are becoming of interest, as these are able to monitor at least thousands of sites simultaneously. However, it has become apparent that important signaling nodes, detectable by phosphosite specific-antibodies are quite often not observed in these large-scale in-depth MS-based studies. Here we addressed this issue by using multiple proteases for protein digestion, thereby increasing the size of the accessible and detectable phosphoproteome. We demonstrate that nearly each phosphosite has a preferred protease which favors detection by MS. For specific sites the use of alternative proteases increases the intensity by more than 1,000 fold. Based on the results we define and make publicly available a human phosphopeptide atlas of more than 37,771 unique phosphopeptides, correlating to over 18,000 unique phosphosites, that will be useful for both shot-gun as well as targeted MRM/PRM/SWATH based phosphoproteomics studies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001428
Human bladder,colon,kidney,liver cancer LC MS/MS	We propose that enrichment of low-abundance proteins benefits MPs finding. ProteoMinerTM is an equalizing technique by reducing high-abundance proteins and enriching low-abundance proteins in biological liquids. With triton X-100/TBS buffer extraction, ProteoMinerTM enrichment and peptide fractionation, 25 MPs with 73 unique peptides were identified from four human tissues, including 10 membrane proteins and 6 nucleus proteins. Then 18 MPs were confirmed with at least 2 unique peptide identification and 6 MPs were confirmed with 1 unique peptide identification by PRM assay. Hence these results demonstrated ProteoMinerTM as a powerful means in discovery of MPs.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006833
Deep Dive in the Proteome of Human Cerebrospinal Fluid: A Valuable Data Resource for Biomarker Discovery and Missing Protein Identification	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a body fluid of choice for biomarker studies of brain disorders but remains relatively under-studied compared to other biological fluids such as plasma, partly due to the more invasive means of its sample collection. The present study establishes an in-depth CSF proteome through the analysis of a unique CSF sample from a pool of healthy donors. After immuno-affinity depletion, the CSF sample was fractionated using off-gel electrophoresis and analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS) using the latest generation of hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometers. The shotgun proteomic analysis allowed the identification of 20689 peptides mapping on 3379 proteins. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained dataset constitutes the largest CSF proteome published so far. Among the CSF proteins identified, 34% correspond to genes defined as elevated in the brain by The Human Protein Atlas. The principal Alzheimer disease biomarkers (e.g., tau protein, amyloid-β, apolipoprotein E and neurogranin) were detected. Importantly, our dataset significantly contributes to the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP), and 13 proteins considered as missing are proposed for validation in accordance with the HPP guidelines.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009646

Mesenchymal stem cell integrin-associated complexes	The composition and stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment that surrounds Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) stem cells dictates transcriptional programming, thereby affecting stem cell lineage decision-making. Cells sense force  between themselves and their microenvironment controlling the capability of MSCs to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. Force sensing is transmitted by integrin receptors and their associated adhesion signalling complexes. To identify regulators of MSC force sensing we sought to catalogue MSC adhesion complex composition. Therefore we isolated integrin-associated adhesion complexes formed in MSCs plated on the ECM ligand fibronectin.  We identifed proteins using mass spectrometry that define a MSC specific subset of adhesion complex proteins consisting of key linkages to the actin cytoskeleton together with integrin signalling and force sensing components.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001809
L-Ascorbic acid and α-Tocopherol synergistically triggers apoptosis inducing antileukemic effects of arsenic trioxide via oxidative stress in human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.	Chemosensitization is an effective strategy to overcome the drawbacks of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) treatment which may be possible through the use of dietary supplements in combination. Proteomic analysis revealed that the combination of arsenic trioxide with vitamins can alter a number of proteins related to the translation, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways that adds to their effectiveness in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. This study provides the fact that HL-60 cells became more vulnerable to As2O3 in the presence of L-Ascorbic acid and α-Tocopherol indicating that this combination may be a hopeful approach to increase the outcome of As2O3 in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016771

Identification of novel CSF biomarkers in GRN-associated frontotemporal dementia by proteomics	Frontotemporal dementia is the second most common form of presenile dementia and autosomal dominant inheritance is present in 20-30% of cases, with mutations in granulin (GRN) as a major cause. The exact pathophysiological mechanism by which GRN mutations lead to neurodegeneration is poorly understood. We aimed to identify novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in GRN-associated frontotemporal dementia using shotgun proteomics. We included CSF from presymptomatic and symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and healthy non-carriers (controls).

Eicosadomics, proteomics and metabolomics of inflammatory stimulated human fibroblasts reveals specific functions related to chronic inflammation - secreted proteins of untreated cells	Fibroblasts have only recently been identified as important effector cells in inflammation. In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003963
BCL9 provides multi-cellular communication properties in colorectal cancer by interacting with paraspeckle proteins	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, which despite recent advances in treatment, remains incurable due to molecular heterogeneity of tumor cells. The B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9) oncogene functions as a transcriptional co-activator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which plays critical roles in CRC pathogenesis.  Here we have identified a β-catenin-independent function of BCL9 in a poor-prognosis subtype of CRC tumors characterized by expression of stromal and neural associated genes. In response to spontaneous calcium transients or cellular stress, BCL9 is recruited adjacent to the interchromosomal regions, where it stabilizes the mRNA of calcium signaling and neural associated genes by interacting with paraspeckle proteins. BCL9 subsequently promotes tumor progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by sustaining the calcium transients and neurotransmitter-dependent communication among CRC cells. These data provide additional insights into the role of BCL9 in tumor pathogenesis and point towards additional avenues for therapeutic intervention.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016172

Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006571
Alterations in Extracellular Matrix Composition during Aging and Photoaging of the Skin	Human skin is composed of the cell-rich epidermis, the extracellular matrix (ECM) rich dermis, and the hypodermis. Within the dermis, a dense network of ECM proteins provides structural support to the skin and regulates a wide variety of signaling pathways which govern cell proliferation and other critical processes. Both intrinsic aging, which occurs steadily over time, and extrinsic aging (photoaging), which occurs as a result of external insults such as UV radiation, cause alterations to the dermal ECM. In this study, we utilized both quantitative and global proteomics, alongside single harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon autofluorescence (TPAF) imaging, to assess changes in dermal composition during intrinsic and extrinsic aging. We find that both intrinsic and extrinsic aging result in significant decreases in structural ECM integrity, evidenced by decreasing collagen abundance and increasing fibril fragmentation, and ECM-supporting proteoglycans. Intrinsic aging also produces changes distinct from those produced by photoaging, including reductions in elastic fiber and crosslinking enzyme abundance. In contrast, photoaging is primarily defined by increases in elastic fiber-associated protein and pro-inflammatory proteases. Changes induced by photoaging are evident even in comparisons of young underarm and forearm skin, indicating that photoexposure experienced by an individual’s mid-20s is sufficient for large-scale proteomic alterations and that molecular-level changes due to photoaging are evident well before clinical indications are present. GO term enrichment revealed that both intrinsic aging and photoaging share common features of chronic inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015982

Comprehensive proteome profiling of platelet identified a protein profile predictive of responses to an antiplatelet agent sarpogrelate.	Here, we performed a comprehensive proteome profiling of platelets collected from 18 healthy subjects before and after administration of sarpogrelate. For each subject, platelets were isolated before and then again after drug administration to investigate the alteration in the platelet proteome by sarpogrelate. A sample preparation method involving filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was used to improve extraction of proteins including both soluble and membraneous proteins. Moreover, an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) coupled with extensive fractionation was used to generate a comprehensive proteome of platelets.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003613
ozone-derived oxisterols impair lung macrophage phagocytosis via adduction of phagocytosis receptors	Inhalation of the amibient air polution ozone causes lung inflammation and can suppress host defense mechanisms, including impairing macrophage phagocytosis. Ozone reacts with cholesterol in the lung to form oxysterols, like secosterol A and secosterol B, which can form covalent adducts on cellular proteins. How oxysterol-protein adduction modifies the function of lung macrophages is unknown. Herein, we used a preoteomic screen to identify lung macrophage proteins that fomr adducts with ozone-derived oxysterols. Analysis show that the phagocytic receptor CD206 and CD64 formed adducts with secosterol A. Adduction of these receptors with ozone-derived oxysterols impaired ligand binding and corresponded with reduced macrophage phagocytosis. This work suggests a novle mechanism for the suppression of macrophage phagocytosis following ozone exposure through the generation of oxysterols and the formation of oxysterol-protein adducts on phagocytic receptors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD019317
Proteomics of Extracellular Vesicles Harvested with ExtraPEG	Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to isolate virus particles from culture medium. This project adapted and optimized the virus procedure for harvesting extracellular vesicles (of similar biophysical properties to viruses) from media. An 8% PEG solution harvested the purest vesicles. Followed by a wash step (ultracentrifugation of concentrated vesicles in saline), this method produced preparations comparable or superior to commonly used methods in terms of purity, abundance, and cost. It is also highly adaptable, allowing the procedure to be used for enriching vesicles from a variety of biological fluids. As proof of principle, extracellular vesicle protein was successfully harvested from HeLa cell medium using the described PEG-based harvest method and analyzed by mass spectrophotometry.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003209

Quantification of cytokines secreted by primary human cells using MRM: evaluation of analytical parameters – shotgun secretome data of inflammatory stimulated HUVECs	The determination of secreted proteins may provide highly valuable information about cell functions. While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002211
Proteomic Analysis of Protein in Human Fingerprints and Artificial Fingerprints	Quantitative genomic and proteomic evaluation of human latent fingerprint depositions represents a challenge within the forensic field, due to the high variability in the amount of DNA and protein initially deposited. To better assess recovery techniques for touch depositions, we present a method to produce simple and customizable artificial fingerprints. Capitalizing on recent advancements in the use of protein sequence identification for human forensic analysis, these samples contain a representative quantity of protein, originating from epidermal skin cells collected from the fingers and palms of volunteers. Proteomic sequencing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis indicates a high level of protein overlap between artificial and latent prints.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015445
Protein abundance comparison of human cells infected with Shigella flexneri over different time periods	The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri invades the intestinal epithelium of humans. During infection, several injected effector proteins promote bacterial internalization, and interfere with multiple host cell responses. To obtain a systems-level overview of host signaling during infection, we analyzed the global dynamics of protein phosphorylation by LC-MS/MS and identified several hundred of proteins undergoing a phosphorylation change during the first hours of infection. Functional bioinformatic analysis revealed that they were mostly related to the cytoskeleton, transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle. Fuzzy c-means clustering identified six temporal profiles of phosphorylation and a functional module composed of ATM-phosphorylated proteins related to genotoxic stress. Pathway enrichment analysis defined mTOR as the most overrepresented pathway. We showed that mTOR complex 1 and 2 were required for S6 kinase and AKT activation, respectively. Comparison with a published phosphoproteome of Salmonella typhimurium-infected cells (PMID:21934108, PRIDE experiment accessions 18477 and 18485) revealed a large subset of co-regulated phosphoproteins. Finally, we showed that S. flexneri effector OspF affected the phosphorylation of several hundred proteins, thereby demonstrating the wide-reaching impact of a single bacterial effector on the host signaling network.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000219
Positional proteomics reveals differences in N-terminal proteoform stability.	To understand the impact of alternative translation initiation on a proteome, we performed the first large-scale study of protein turnover rates in which we distinguish between N-terminal proteoforms pointing to translation initiation events. Using pulsed SILAC combined with N-terminal COFRADIC we monitored the stability of 1,941human N-terminal proteoforms, including 147 proteoform pairs with heterogeneous N-termini originating from the same gene that result from alternative translation initiation and incomplete processing of the initiator methionine. N-terminally truncated proteoforms were on average less abundant than canonical proteoforms, many had different stabilities and exhibited both faster and slower turnover rates compared to their canonical counterparts. These differences in stability did not depend on the length of truncation but on individual protein characteristics. In silico simulation of N-terminal proteoforms in macromolecular complexes revealed possible consequences for complex integrity such as replacement of unstable canonical subunits. The extent of intrinsic disorder in N-terminal protein structures correlated with turnover times, indicating that a change in the structural flexibility of protein N-termini in truncated proteoforms might impact proteoform stability. Interestingly, removal of the initiator methionine by methionine aminopeptidases reduced the stability of processed proteoforms while susceptibility for N-terminal acetylation, another common co-translational modification, did not seem to impact on turnover rates. Taken together, our findings reveal differences in protein stability between N-terminal proteoforms and point to a role for alternative translation initiation and co-translational initiator methionine removal in the overall regulation of proteome homeostasis.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002091
Quantitative ER chemical proteomics with ER-localizable reactive molecules under ER-stress condition	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that performs a variety of essential cellular functions via interactions with other organelles. Despite its important role, chemical tools for profiling the composition and dynamics of ER proteins remain very limited because of the labile nature of these proteins. Here, we developed ER-localizable reactive molecules (called ERMs) as tools for ER-focused chemical proteomics. ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology. Our results demonstrated that ERM-based chemical proteomics provides a powerful tool for labeling and profiling ER-related proteins in living cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011619
Determination of Supplier-To-Supplier and Lot-To-Lot Variability in Glycation of Recombinant Human Serum Albumin Expressed in Oryza sativa	In studies presented here, recombinant human serum albumins (rHSA) produced in Oryza sativa (Asian rice) (OsrHSA) from a number of suppliers have been extensively characterized and compared to plasma-derived HSA (pHSA) and rHSA expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Modifications of the samples were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with samples further assessed with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE) as well as additionally biophysical techniques. LC-MS analysis identified a greater number of hexose-glycated arginine and lysine residues on OsrHSA compared to pHSA or rHSA expressed in yeast. Lot-to-lot variability of OsrHSA glycation from one manufactures supplied products were further identified. The extensive glycation of OsrHSA from multiple suppliers may have further implications for the use of OsrHSA as a therapeutic product.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001248
Human pancreatic cancer LC-MSMS	Despite decades of effort, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains an intractable clinical challenge. An insufficient understanding of mechanisms underlying tumor cell responses to chemotherapy contributes significantly to the lack of effective treatment regimens. Here, paclitaxel, a first-line chemotherapeutic agent, was observed to interact synergistically with birinapant, a Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases mimetic. Therefore, we investigated molecular-level drug interaction mechanisms using comprehensive, reproducible, and well-controlled ion-current-based MS1 quantification (IonStar). In a set of 40 biological samples, we compared temporal proteomic responses of PDAC cells treated with birinapant and paclitaxel, alone and combined. Using stringent criteria (e.g. strict false-discovery-rate FDR control, 2 peptides/protein), we quantified 4069 unique proteins confidently (99.8% without any missing data), and 541 proteins were significantly altered in the three treatment groups with a FDR of <1%. Interestingly, most of these proteins were altered only by combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and these predominantly represented three biological processes: mitochondrial function, cell growth and apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Proteins responsible for activation of oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β-oxidation, and inactivation of aerobic glycolysis were altered largely by combined birinapant/paclitaxel compared to single drugs, suggesting that the Warburg effect, which is employed by PDAC cells for survival and proliferation, was alleviated by the combination treatment. Metabolic profiling confirmed substantially greater suppression of the Warburg effect by the combined agents compared to either drug alone. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in apoptosis/survival signaling pathways, such as inhibition of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK signal transduction, as well as induction of G2/M arrest, and the drug combination induced much more apoptosis than did single agents. Overall, this in-depth, large-scale proteomics study provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying synergy of combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and describes a proteomics/informatics pipeline that can be applied broadly to the development of cancer drug combination regimens.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007890
Human_MCF7_membrane -  Searching Missing Proteins Based on the Optimization of Membrane Protein Enrichment and Digestion Process	MCF7 cell was an important stabilized breast cancer cell in cancer research. A membrane proteomic method was developed and compared in this study. A membrane protein enrichment method composed of ultra-centrifugation and detergent-based extraction was first developed. Then in-solution digestion with detergents and eFASP (enhanced filter aided sample preparation) with detergents were compared with the time consuming in-gel digestion method. Our data indicated that ultra-centrifugation combined detergent-based extraction can effectively enrich membrane proteins with higher purity. Among the in-solution digestion methods, the eFASP combined with RapiGest method identified 1125 membrane proteins. Similarly, the eFASP combined with SDC identified 1069 membrane proteins, however, the in-gel digestion characterized 1091 membrane proteins. Totally, with the 5 digestion methods, 1390 membrane proteins were identified with ≥1 unique peptides, among which 1345 membrane proteins contain unique peptides ≥2. This is the biggest membrane protein datasets for MCF7 cell line and even breast cancer tissue samples. Interestingly, we realized that 9 missing proteins (MPs) present with one or more unique peptides. After verification, 4 of them were validated by synthesized peptide with amino acids larger than 9.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004131
Improving fractionation of human milk proteins through calcium phosphate co-precipitation and their rapid characterization by capillary electrophoresis	This work describes a simple sample pretreatment method for the fractionation of human milk proteins (into their two main groups: whey and caseins) prior to their analysis. The protein extraction protocol is based on the addition of calcium phosphate to non-adjusted pH human milk. The combination of calcium ions with phosphate results in an effective co-precipitation of caseins. To assess the suitability of this fractionation protocol, the protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and CE analysis. The results evidence a significant decrease in contamination of casein fraction with whey proteins and vice versa compared with the conventional isoelectric precipitation of caseins. In addition, CE fraction collection coupled to LC-MS/MS (off-line coupling) has been successfully applied to the identification of minor proteins in this complex matrix. The methodology presented here constitutes a promising tool to enlarge the knowledge of human milk proteome.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010315
Update on virtual-experimental 2DE approach in chromosome-centric human proteome project	In the boundaries of chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project c-HPP to obtain information about proteoforms coded by chromosome 18, several cell lines were analyzed. In our study we have been using proteoform separation by 2DE (sectional analysis) and semi-virtual 2DE with following shotgun mass-spectrometry using LC ESI-MS/MS. Previously, we published a first draft of this research, where only HepG2 cells were used. Here, next step was done using liver, glioblastoma, fibroblasts, kidney cells and plasma. Altogether, confident (2 significant sequences minimum) information about proteoforms coded by ~80 genes was obtained. The 3D-graphs showing distribution of different proteoforms from the same gene in 2D map were generated.

Determination of a tumor-promoting microenvironment in recurrent medulloblastoma: a multi-omics study of cerebrospinal fluid	Molecular characterization of medulloblastoma (MB) cell origin and properties is the basis for a well-defined classification system. However, limited data is available regarding the MB tumor microenvironment. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based multi-omics study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from recurrent MB patients. A group of age-matched patients without a neoplastic disease was used as control cohort. Proteome profiling identified several characteristic tumor markers and revealed a strong prevalence of anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting proteins characteristic for alternatively polarized myeloid cells in MB samples. The up-regulation of ADAMTS1, GAP43 and GPR37 indicated hypoxia in CSF of MB patients. This notion was independently supported by metabolomics, demonstrating up-regulation of tryptophan, methionine, serine and lysine, all of which have been described to be induced upon hypoxia in CSF. The beta-oxidation promoting lipid hormone 12,13-DiHOME was found strongly upregulated, potentially promoting a metabolic shift supporting drug resistance and stem cell properties of MB cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD018226
Scanning quadrupole DIA -  Scanning Quadrupole Data Independent Acquisition - Part A	A scanning quadrupole data independent acquisition (DIA) method is described and characterised for the qualitative and quantitative label free proteomic analysis of complex biological samples. The principle of the scanning quadrupole DIA is discussed and the effect of the optimization of analytical instrument characteristics, such as acquisition speed, sample complexity, and scan/integration time in relation to sample complexity for a number of different model proteomes of various complexity and dynamic range, including plasma, human cell lines, and bacteria samples, discussed. In addition, its technological merits from an acquisition neutral perspective are reviewed. The qualitative and semi-quantitative performance of the method is illustrated and contrasted for the analysis of a well-characterised human cell line sample using untargeted and targeted search strategies. The application of the method is demonstrated for the analysis of the calcineurin-dependent proteome of drug treated Aspergillus fumigatus. The design of these experiments afforded assessment of the precision and accuracy of scanning quadrupole data independent acquisition (DIA) method as will be demonstrated by peptide and protein centric analysis of the study pool QC samples of the study. Moreover, novel and specific interactors in response to drug treatment that are indicative of the role of calcineurin role in regulating these effectors have been identified.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005869

Dairy pastoralism sustained Eastern Eurasian steppe populations for 5000 years	Through the use of proteomic analysis of 32 dental calculus samples from anceint Mongolia, we show that ruminant  dairying was present in Mongolia by at least 3000 B.C.E., over 1500 years prior to previously published work. Excitingly, the earliest site with dairy evidence has been identified as archaeologically Afanasievo, supporting the hypothesis that dairy practices and animals likely entered the Eastern steppe with migrating western steppe populations. Furthermore, at 1200 B.C.E. we detect the first direct evidence for horse milk consumption, demonstrating the Bronze Age origins of equine dairying on the eastern steppe which occurred concomitantly with early evidence for horse bridling and riding in the region. The incorporation of horse milk and riding into early Mongolian subsistence strategies led to dramatic economic and demographic shifts that enabled the formation of the well-known steppe empires.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014730

Multi-OMICS data of a Hyper IgD Syndrome family	The aim of this study was to understand why two siblings carrying both the same homozygous causal mutation for the auto-inflammatory disease hyper IgD show opposite phenotypes, i.e. the first being asymptomatic, the second presenting all classical characteristics of the disease. As compared to studies of a single omics type, the multi-omics approach becomes a method of choice to resolve complex traits.  Here we combined exome, proteome and transcriptome analysis in the two siblings and identified a single gene - STAT1 - harboring a rare missense variant and showing mRNA and protein abundances significantly more important in the symptomatic than the asymptomatic sister. This mutation was shown to be a gain of function mutation involved in an increased activation of the JAK/STAT pathway which is known to play a critical role in inflammatory diseases and for which specific bio-therapies exist.  Pathway analysis based on information from differentially expressed transcripts and proteins confirmed the central role of STAT1 in the proposed regulatory network leading to an increased inflammatory phenotype in the symptomatic sibling. In addition, we provide a proteogenomics analysis pipeline that takes advantage of subject-specific genomic and transcriptomic information to improve protein identifications. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the power of a multi-omics approach to uncover potentially clinically actionable targets for a personalized therapy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009063
Analysis of plasma proteome of pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder of fertile-aged women. PCOS has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and abnormalities of the placenta. By taking a quantitative label-free quantitative proteomics approach we set out to investigate if changes in the plasma proteome of pregnant women with PCOS could elucidate the mechanisms behind the pathologies observed in PCOS pregnancies. We have performed label-free quantitative proteomics on plasma samples from pregnant women with PCOS at term (n=14) and plasma samples from pregnant control women (n = 23) matched for age, gestational length and BMI. The samples are derived from BASIC pregnancy cohort from Uppsala, Sweden.

Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - secreted proteins of inflammatory stimulated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003411
Lack of activity of recombinant HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) on reported non-HIF substrates	Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes catalyse the posttranslational hydroxylation of conserved prolyl residues in the alpha-subunit of the HIF transcription factor. These modifications, which promote the degradation of HIF-alpha subunits by the pVHL E3 ligase complex and impart oxygen-dependent regulation of the HIF transcriptional response, have been extensively characterised at the molecular, cellular and organismal level. Since the discovery of the PHDs, a range of less well-characterised non-HIF substrates have been reported with the potential to confer oxygen-sensitivity to a diverse range of cellular processes. We sought to systematically compare all of the reported non-HIF substrates for their ability to support PHD-catalysed hydroxylation. We performed a comprehensive series of in vitro hydroxylation assays reacting synthetic peptides and full-length protein substrates generated by in vitro transcription and translation with purified recombinant enzyme preparations. Prolyl hydroxylation was assayed directly by mass spectrometry and radiochemical assay for hydroxyproline. Both methods enabled quantitative appraisal of enzyme-catalysed hydroxylation, with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods employing NMR-quantified peptide standards to calibrate retention time signatures and determine ionisation efficiencies for each target peptide. Using these approaches we assayed hydroxylation on 23 different proteins. Surprisingly, we did not detect measurable hydroxylation on any of the reported non-HIF substrates using either method. In contrast, control assays with HIF1-alpha substrate supported high stoichiometry (typically >90%) hydroxylation. Our findings suggest that PHD substrates are more restricted than has been reported.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013112
A secretome profile indicative of oleate-induced proliferation of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line	Increased fatty acid (FA) is often observed in highly proliferative tumors, contributing to promoting proliferation of tumor cells. FA affects secreted factors from tumor cells, which can modulate tumor microenvironment in favor of tumor survival. However, the secreted factors affected by the increased FA have not been systematically explored. Here, we performed comprehensive secretome profiling of oleate-treated and untreated HepG2 cells. Comparison of the secretomes identified 349 differentially secreted proteins (DSPs; 145 up-regulated and 192 down-regulated) in oleate-treated samples, compared to untreated samples. Functional enrichment and network analyses of the DSPs revealed that the 145 up-regulated secreted proteins by oleate treatment were mainly associated with cell proliferation-related processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and ER stress. Based on the network models of the DSPs, we selected four up-regulated secreted proteins (MIF, THBS1, PDIA3, and APOA1) that can represent such processes related to cell proliferation. Thus, our results provided a secretome profile indicative of oleate-induced proliferation of HepG2 cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007906
Identification of ALDH6A1 as a Potential Signature in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Quantitative Profiling of the Mitochondrial Proteome	Various liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, a condition characterized by abnormal levels of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we subjected the human liver mitochondrial proteome to an extensive quantitative proteomic profiling analysis and molecular characterization to identify potential signatures indicative of cancer cell growth and progression. A sequential proteomic analysis identified 2452 mitochondrial proteins, of which 1464 and 2010 were classified as normal and HCC mitochondrial proteins, respectively, with 1022 overlaps. Further metabolic mapping of the HCC mitochondrial proteins narrowed our biological characterization to four proteins, namely ALDH4A1, LRPPRC, ATP5C1 and ALDH6A1. The latter protein, a mitochondrial methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH6A1), was most strongly suppressed in HCC tumor regions (~10-fold decrease) and was predicted to present in plasma. Accordingly, we selected ALDH6A1 for a functional analysis. Interestingly, much lower NO levels were detected in both HCC tumor regions and an ALDH6A1-overexpression (O/E) cell line than in control (Hep3B) cells and could be restored by treatment with S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine. In contrast, ALDH6A1-O/E cells exhibited an approximately 50% increase in ROS levels and decreased lactate levels relative to control cells. Propidium iodine staining suggested that the abnormal decrease in NO and increase in ROS could be caused by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). We propose that an attenuated ALDH6A1 level may subsequently promote uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, act as a signature for assessing HCC progression and treatment responses.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014252
Evaluation of NCI-7 Cell Line Panel	Reference materials are vital to benchmarking the reproducibility of clinical tests and essential for monitoring laboratory performance for clinical proteomics. The reference material utilized for mass spectrometric analysis of the human proteome would ideally contain enough proteins to be suitably representative of the human proteome, as well as exhibit a stable protein composition in different batches of sample regeneration. Previously, The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) utilized PDX-derived comparative reference (CompRef) materials for the longitudinal assessment of proteomic performance, however, inherent drawbacks of PDX-derived material has resulted in efforts to identify a new source of CompRef material. In this study, we examined the utility of using a panel of seven cancer cell lines, NCI-7 Cell Line Panel, as a reference material for mass spectrometric analysis of the human proteome. Our results showed that not only is the NCI-7 material suitable for benchmarking laboratory sample preparation methods, but NCI-7 sample generation is highly reproducible at both the global and phosphoprotein levels. In addition, the predicted genomic and experimental coverage of the NCI-7 proteome suggests the NCI-7 material may also have applications as a universal standard proteomic reference.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008952
A comprehensive protein profile analysis from clinical Sialoliths and its practical implications	We analyzed 29 Sialolith samples, employing classical Population Genetic principles (Hartl and Clark 1980 (1), Hahn 2018 (2)) and Systems Biology analysis (ed: by Rigoustsos and Stephanopoulos 2006 (3)) approaches to create specific algorithms designed for our research objectives. Using these methodologies, specific unknowns such as the intrinsic variability of salivary stones, the role that protein matrix plays in the structure and evolution of the stones, and the nature of their interaction with the inorganic phase were addressed. In addition, the genetic and bio-functional aspects as classifying parameters were included and established an experimental frame of comparisons.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD012422
Protein expression in TKI-resistant RCC cells.	Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an essential issue concerning targeted therapy in renal cancer. This research focuses on molecular background of resistance to axitinib and sorafenib observed from the very beginning of a standard two-dimensional cell culture in monolayer as well as in three-dimensional models (soft agar and suspension cultures). Resistance was observed only in commercially available human kidney cancer stem cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed several proteins which may be functionally connected with the resistance to axitinib in normoxia and to sorafenib in hypoxia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002600
Unique insights in cervicovaginal Lactobacillus iners and L. crispatus proteome changes associated with microbiome dysbiosis	Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL)supernatants were heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C before further processing. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Sample protein content and volume were normalised with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). Soluble proteins were precipitated using an equal volume of ice cold 30% (w/v) TCA in acetone and incubated at -20⁰C for 2 hours. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes (4⁰C) to pellet proteins. Pellets were washed three times with ice cold acetone and allowed to air dry. Further sample processing was performed as previously described (Armstrong et al, 2014) with minor modifications. Briefly, protein pellets were resuspended in 25 mM ABC, 0.05%(w/v) rapigest (Waters), reduced and alkylated. Digestion was performed with proteomic-grade trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a protein:trypsin ratio of 50:1. Rapigest was precipitated by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v). Peptide mixtures were analyzed by on-line nanoflow liquid chromatography using the nanoACQUITY-nLC system (Waters MS technologies) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer equipped with the manufacturer’s nanospray ion source. The gradient of the analytic column (nanoACQUITY UPLCTM BEH130 C18 15cm x 75µm, 1.7µm capillary column) consisted of 3-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 90 min then a ramp of 40-85% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 5min.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003176
Proteomic profiling of colorectal adenomas	Colorectal adenomas are cancer precursor lesions of the large bowel.

TurboRAW2MGF: Removing isobaric-related ions improves the peptide/protein identification	Isobaric labelling technique coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry has been widely employed in the proteomics workflows requiring relative quantification. For each high resolution tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS), it can be used not only to quantify the peptide from different samples by reporter ions，but also to identify the peptide it derived from. Since isobaric related ions act as noises in database searching, the MS/MS spectrum should be preprocessed before peptide/protein identification. In this paper, we demonstrated that there were a lot of high frequency, high abundance isobaric related ions in MS/MS spectrum. By combining removing isobaric related ions with deisotoping and deconvolution in MS/MS preprocessing procedure, the peptide/protein identification sensitivity improved significantly. A user-friendly software TurboRaw2MGF (v2.0) has been implemented for converting  raw TIC data files to mascot generic format files which can be downloaded for free from https://github.com/shengqh/RCPA.Tools/releases as part of the software suite ProteomicsTools.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000994
An immunoproteomic approach to characterize the CAR interactome and signalosome	Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells is expected to become the first line of treatment for multiple malignancies, following the enormous success of anti-CD19 therapies. However, their mechanism of action is not fully understood, and clear guidelines for the design of safe and efficient receptors are missing. We hereby describe a systematic analysis of the CAR “interactome” in human primary T cells, which allowed us to identify molecular traits that influence CAR-T cell efficacy. Interactome analysis was based on immunoprecipitation of CARs followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007085

CEP19-RABL2 GTPase complex in ciliary transport	The mechanisms of how highly conserved intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein complexes direct ciliary entry remain unknown. Exploring human ciliopathy genes, including monogenic obesity syndrome genes, has been a rich source of critical ciliary mechanisms. Using AP-MS purification of interactors of the CEP19 monogenic obesity gene, we identify factors and the first known mechanism for triggering ciliary entry of IFT complexes. CEP19 binds the CEP350 and FOP centriolar components and the highly conserved RABL2 GTPase. We discovered that the CEP19-RABL2 complex is first recruited by the centriolar CEP350/FOP complex, concurrently activates nucleotide exchange to capture and release intraflagellar transport B holocomplexes from a large centriolar pool to intraflagellar transport. The CEP19 network of interacting proteins regulates ciliary entry and ciliation, providing a new example of ciliary mechanisms deficient in monogenic obesity syndromes.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006757

Cancer associated fibroblast-derived WNT2 increases tumor angiogenesis in colon cancer	WNT2 is important for placenta vascularization and acts as a pro-angiogenic factor for liver and other endothelial cells (ECs). WNT2 induction has been shown in many carcinomas and is associated with tumor progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC) WNT2 is selectively elevated in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to increased invasion and metastasis. However, if there is a role for WNT2 in colon cancer angiogenesis has not been addressed so far.  Here, we demonstrate that WNT2 enhances EC migration and invasion, while it induces ß catenin dependent signaling in only a small subset of HUVECs. We show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of WNT2 in CAFs reduced the growth of vessel-like structures significantly in a co-culture assay, while the overexpression of WNT2 in skin fibroblasts otherwise being devoid of WNT2 led to increased angiogenesis in vitro. In a xenograft model, overexpression of WNT2 in HCT116 led to enhanced tumor volume and vessel density. Moreover, WNT2 expression correlates with vessel markers in human CRC. Secretome profiling of CAFs revealed that proteins related to angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are regulated by WNT2. Thus, stroma-derived WNT2 positively affects angiogenesis in CRC by shifting the balance towards pro-angiogenic signals.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014019
Direct evidence of milk consumption from ancient human dental calculus, UK	This study investigated the consumption of milk products in the archaeological record, utilizing human dental calculus as a reservoir of dietary proteins from archaeological samples from across Eurasia. Protein extraction and generation of tryptic peptides from dental calculus was performed using a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol, modified for ancient samples, on 92 samples of archaeological dental calculus. Samples were extracted at three laboratories; the Functional Genomics Centre Zürich (FGCZ), the Centre for GeoGenetics at the National History Museum of Denmark, and BioArCh at the University of York.

Proteomic investigations of human HERC2 mutants: insights into the pathobiology of a neurodevelopmental disorder	HERC2 is a giant protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and other known and suspected functions. Mutations of HERC2 are implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers and result in various severe neurological conditions in Herc2-mutant mice. Recently, a pleotropic autosomal recessive HERC2-associated syndrome of intellectual disability, autism and variable neurological deficits was described; its pathogenetic basis is largely unknown. Using peripheral  blood-derived lymphoblasts from 3 persons with homozygous HERC2 variants and 14 age- and gender-matched controls, we performed unbiased HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses to provide insights into HERC2-mediated pathobiology. We found that out of 3427 detected proteins, there were 812 differentially expressed proteins between HERC2-cases vs. controls. 184 canonical pathways were enriched after FDR adjustment, including mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, EIF2 signaling, immune functions, ubiquitination and DNA repair. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® identified 209 upstream regulators that could drive the differential expression, prominent amongst which were neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Differentially expressed protein interaction networks highlighted themes of immune function/dysfunction, regulation of cell cycle/cell death, and energy metabolism. Overall, the analysis of the HERC2-associated proteome revealed striking differential protein expression between cases and controls. The large number of differentially expressed proteins likely reflects HERC2’s multiple domains and numerous interacting proteins. Our canonical pathway and protein interaction network findings suggest derangements of multiple pathways in HERC2-associated disease.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD012644
AP-MS analysis of sirtuin-4 interactions in human fibroblasts	Sirtuins (SIRTs) form a critical family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent enzymes that govern genome regulation, metabolism, and aging. Despite conserved deacetylase domains, SIRTs4-7 have little to no deacetylase activity, and a robust catalytic activity for mitochondrial SIRT4 has remained elusive. Moreover, in vitro characterization of SIRT4 has been hampered by difficulty in maintaining soluble and active recombinant protein. Therefore, to investigate potential cellular substrates of SIRT4, we used proteomics to define its mitochondrial protein interactions in human fibroblasts.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001447
Proteomic analysis of CSF from patients with leptomeningeal melanoma metastases identifies signatures associated with disease progression and therapeutic resistance	The development of leptomeningeal melanoma metastases (LMM) is a rare and devastating complication of the late-stage disease, for which no effective treatments exist. Here, we performed a multi-omics analysis of the CSF from LMM patients to determine how the leptomeningeal microenvironment shapes the biology and therapeutic responses of melanoma cells. A total of 45 serial CSF samples were collected from 16 patients, 8 of these with confirmed LMM. Of those with LMM, 7 had poor survival (<4 months) and one was an extraordinary responder (still alive with survival >32 months). CSF samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry and incubated with melanoma cells, that were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. Functional assays were performed to validate the pathways identified.  Mass spectrometry analyses showed the CSF of most LMM patients to be enriched for pathways involved in innate immunity, protease-mediated damage, and IGF-related signaling. All of these were anti-correlated in the extraordinary responder. RNA-Seq analysis showed CSF to induce PI3K/AKT, integrin, B-cell activation, S-phase entry, TNFR2, TGF- and oxidative stress responses in the melanoma cells. ELISA assays confirmed that TGF- expression increased in the CSF of patients progressing with LMM. CSF from poorly responding patients conferred tolerance to BRAF inhibitor therapy in apoptosis assays.  These analyses identified proteomic/transcriptional signatures in the CSF of patients who succumbed to LMM. We further showed that the CSF from LMM patients has the potential to modulate BRAF inhibitor responses and may contribute to drug resistance.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016002

protein-protein interaction dataset TNFR1-mediated NFkB signaling	Most MS-based approaches to study protein-protein interactions require homogenization of the cells, which leads to loss of the cellular structures, dilution of proteins and formation of incorrect protein complexes. Furthermore, several purification and washing steps are needed, which can lead to the loss of (weaker) interactions. We recently developed a new method for studying protein complexes without interfering with the cellular integrity; Virotrap. By trapping and purifying protein complexes in virus-like particles, we avoid cell lysis and preserve intact complexes during the purification process.  Here, we present a protein-protein interaction network of the TNFR1-induced NF-κB and apoptosis pathway, using TRADD, FADD, TRAF2, cIAP1, NEMO, TANK, HOIL1, HOIP, SHARPIN, A20, ABIN1 and ABIN2 as baits in Virotrap. Virotrap was applied both under resting conditions as well as upon TNF stimulation, which reveals dynamic interactions in TNFR1-induced NF-κB signaling. The found interactions compromise both known interactors as well as novel ones that might serve as valuable resource for further unraveling the molecular mechanisms controlling inflammation, cellular proliferation and cell death.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009366
Proteomic Evidence of Ancient Mongolian Dietary Dairy Sources in Ancient Dental Calculus	To investigate dairy consumption in ancient Mongolia, we analysed dental calculus samples from four Late Bronze Age (LBA, 1500-1000 BCE) individuals for proteomic evidence of milk proteins. As many archaeological sites before Mongolia's Iron Age suffer from a dearth of occupational materials, looking to biomolecular markers of dietary intake can open new investigational avenues into ancient economies. In this case, we use a previously established method of extracting proteins from calculus to explore the consumption of dairy products at LBA Khirigsuur sites in northern Mongolia's Hovsgol Aimag. Seven of nine individual's calculus contained peptides from the whey protein Beta-lactoglobulin from Ovis, Capra hircus, Bos, and general Bovidae species.  Aside from proteomics, these and 16 other individuals from the site were analysed for aDNA. We found that 18 of the 20 were primarily from one genetic ancestral group, and Ancient North Eurasian (ANE). One of the outliers represents a combination of ANE and Western Steppe Herder (WSH), with the other a combination of ANE and Eastern Asian (EE). This finding, while important in its own right, evidences the earliest known dairy consumption in Mongolia, and supports a widely held assumption that pastoralism was a primary subsistence strategy in the ancient Eastern Steppes. The combined proteomic and DNA evidence suggest that Western Steppe dairy animals and technology entered Mongolia before genetic admixture.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008217
Cell Surface Expression with FK866	Maintenance of NAD+ levels by mitochondrial complex I, the NAD+ salvage pathway, and other routes is an important factor in of neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Both the production of NAD+ and the metabolic enzymes that require it as a redox cofactor or substrate differ widely in abundance across cell types and conditions. Disruption in the NAD+ supply thus exerts different effects depending on the cellular NAD+ requirements existing in the cell. Pharmacological depletion of NAD+ is actively being pursued in cancer and other diseases but these effects are not fully understood. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics and metabolomics to understand the consequences of disrupting cellular NAD+ levels and find that inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway depletes serine biosynthesis from glucose by impeding the NAD+-dependent protein 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, breast cancers that depend on PHGDH are exquisitely sensitive to blocking the NAD+ salvage pathway. PHGDH, and the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage are also correlated in public tumor proteome and transcript datasets. These findings are immediately translatable to the pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT in PHGDH-dependent cancers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007791

Systematic characterization of BAF mutations explains intra-complex synthetic lethalities	Aberrations in genes coding for subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex are highly abundant in human cancers. Currently, it is not understood how these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically. The cancer type specific occurrence patterns of certain subunit mutations suggest subunit-specific effects on BAF complex function, possibly by the formation of aberrant residual complexes. Here, we systematically characterize the effects of individual subunit loss on complex composition, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in a panel of knock-out cell lines deficient for 22 targetable BAF subunits. We observe strong, specific and often discordant alterations dependent on the targeted subunit and show that these explain intra-complex co-dependencies, including the novel synthetic lethal interactions SMARCA4-ARID2, SMARCA4-ACTB and SMARCC1-SMARCC2. These data provide insights into the role of different BAF subcomplexes in genome-wide chromatin organization and suggest novel approaches to therapeutically target BAF mutant cancers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013102
Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma aggressiveness associated with differential expression of collagen and STAT1	Background: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) is a rare but debilitating disease. One vSCC subtype comprises tumor cells that grow and expand as a cohesive sheet of cells that “pushes” and compresses the associated lymphoplasmacytic (LPC) stroma. Another vSCC subtype features tumor cells that grow in loose association with other tumor cells and infiltrate the associated fibromyxoid (FMX) stroma consisting mainly of extracellular matrix. Clinically, infiltrative vSCC with FMX stroma (Inf/FMX) is significantly associated with lymph node metastases and recurrence. Methods: An unbiased proteomic approach was used to identify pathways that could produce these different vSCC subtypes. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 10 cases of pushing vSCC with LPC stroma (Push/LPC) and 8 cases of Inf/FMX were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Analysis identified 2,265 different proteins in the 18 samples of vSCC. Of these, 344 proteins were differentially expressed (p<0.05) by at least 4-fold between vSCC subtypes. Of these, 59 were higher and 285 lower in Inf/FMX compared to Push/LPC tumors. Consistent with the desmoplastic morphology and increased picrosirius red staining, expression of subunits of several collagens (Col 1, 3, 6, 14, 18) was higher in the more aggressive Inf/FMX tumors. In contrast, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an important regulator of several inflammatory pathways, was expressed at lower levels in the Inf/FMX tumors. This finding was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to STAT1. An informatics analysis of the differing profiles identified differences in the integrin signaling pathway and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. This analysis also linked decreased expression of proteins involved antigen processing and presentation and increased expression of those with cell-matrix adhesion as processes with the more aggressive Inf/FMX vSCC subtype. Conclusions: Comparing the proteomic profiles of vSCC morphologic subtypes indicates that increased expression of collagen subunits and decreased expression of STAT1 are associated with a more aggressive tumor subtype. Informatic analyses further identify alterations in cell interaction with matrix and immune function differ with tumor aggressiveness. Identification of these pathways provides a molecular basis for understanding aggressiveness of vSCC.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006901

Quantitative histone mass spectrometry identifies elevated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in melanoma	Normal cell growth is characterized by a regulated epigenetic program that drives cellular activities such as gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Perturbation of this epigenetic program can lead to events such as mis-regulation of gene transcription and diseases such as cancer. To begin to understand the epigenetic program correlated to the development of melanoma, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of histone posttranslational modifications mis-regulated in melanoma cell culture. Aggressive melanoma cells were found to have elevated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) as well as over-expressed methyltransferase EZH2 that adds the specific modification. The altered epigenetic program that led to elevated H3K27me3 in melanoma cell culture was found to directly silence transcription of the tumor suppressor gene RUNX3. The elevated level of H3K27me3 and silencing of RUNX3 transcription was also validated in advanced stage human melanoma tissues. The study presented underscores the utility of using high resolution mass spectrometry to identify mis-regulated epigenetic programs in diseases such as cancer, which could ultimately lead to the identification of biological markers for diagnostic and prognostic applications.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002471

Kv7.2 LC-MSMS -  Updating in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation and methylation sites of voltage-gated Kv7	Voltage-gated Kv7.2 potassium channels regulate neuronal excitability. The gating of Kv7 channels is regulated by various mediators and neurotransmitters acting via G protein-coupled receptors; the underlying signalling cascades involve phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), Ca2+/Calmodulin and phosphorylation. Recent studies have reported that PIP2 sensitivity of Kv7.2 channels is affected by two PTMs, phosphorylation and methylation, harboured in the PIP2 binding domains. Here this project aimed to update phosphorylation and methylation sites on Kv7.2 from heterologous cells, the rat brain and GST-fusion Kv7.2 N- and C-terminal ends proteins.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005567

SLC15A4 (PHT1) interaction proteomics	Human genetics and mouse models provide compelling evidence for the involvement of SLC15A4 in endosomal TLR activation. To gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism, we set out to identify its binding partners by interaction proteomics. TAP-MS/MS analysis of different SLC15A4 protein variants provided a global view of the SLC15A4 interaction landscape. Among the proteins detected, the uncharacterized protein CXorf21 emerged as a prominent and specific binder. CXorf21 is a X chromosome-encoded gene which has also been linked to SLE by a GWAS. CXorf21 was robustly identified with all the SLC15A4 constructs tested, indicating that the interaction does not require the N-terminal or central cytoplasmic region of the transporter. Reciprocal TAP-MS/MS analysis using tagged CXorf21 identified endogenous SLC15A4 as a specific interactor.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014254

This study expands on our previous research investigating dystrophic stromal aggregates, with the aim of better elucidating the pathomechanism of 2 conditions arising from the most common TGFBI mutations: granular corneal dystrophy (GCD1; R555W), and lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD1; R124C). GCD1 and LCD1 patient corneas were stained with H&E and Congo red to visualise stromal non-amyloid and amyloid deposits, respectively. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate aggregates and extracted protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteins were identified and their approximate abundances were determined. Spectra of TGFBIp peptides were also recorded and quantified. In total, 3 proteins were found within GCD1 aggregates that were absent in the healthy control corneal tissue. In comparison an additional 18 and 24 proteins within stromal LCD1 and Bowman’s LCD1 deposits, respectively, were identified. Variances surrounding the endogenous cleavage sites of TGFBIp were also noted. An increase in the number of residues experiencing cleavage was observed in both GCD1 aggregates and LCD1 deposits. The study reveals previously unknown differences 1 between the protein composition of GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, and confirms the presence of the HtrA1 protease in LCD1-amyloid aggregates. In addition, we find mutation specific differences in the processingof mutant TGFBIp species, which may contribute to the variable phenotypes noted in TGFBI-related dystrophies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002236
Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - secreted proteins of untreated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003410
Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010698
Proteomic characterization of stem cell-derived extracellular matrices	We characterized and compared the proteomic composition of ECM produced in vitro by bone marrow-derived MSC, adipose-derived MSC and neonatal fibroblasts isolated from different donors, employing a multidimensional proteomic approach coupled with label-based quantitative proteomics. Each cell-derived ECM displayed a specific and unique matrisome signature, yet they all shared a common set of proteins. We evaluated the biological response of cells cultured on the different matrices and compared them to cells on standard TCPS. The matrices lead to differential proliferation and gene expression profiles between the cell types and as compared to TCPS, indicating that the cell-derived ECM influence each cell type in a unique manner.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005521
Nuclear PTEN safeguards pre-mRNA splicing to link Golgi apparatus for its tumor suppressive role	Dysregulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing (AS) is closely associated with cancers. However, the relationships between the AS and classic oncogenes/tumor suppressors are largely unknown. Here we show that the deletion of tumor suppressor PTEN alters pre-mRNA splicing in its phosphatase-independent manner, and identify262 PTEN-regulated AS events in 293T cells by RNA sequencing, which are associated with significant worse outcome of cancer patients. Based on these findings, we report that nuclear PTEN interacts with the splicing machinery, spliceosome, to regulate its assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. Especially, the exon-2b exclusion of GOLGA2 contributes to PTEN knockdown-induced tumorigenesis by promoting dramatic Golgi extension and secretion, and PTEN depletion significantly sensitizes cancer cells to secretion inhibitors, Brefeldin A and Golgicide A. Given that many cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that Golgi secretion inhibitors alone or in combination with PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for PTEN-deficient cancers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009681

Normal human mitral valve proteome: a preliminary investigation by gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches	The mitral valve is a highly complex structure which regulates blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle (LV) avoiding a significant forward gradient during diastole or regurgitation during systole. The integrity of the mitral valve is also essential for the maintenance of normal LV size, geometry, and function. Significant advances in the comprehension of the biological, functional, and mechanical behavior of the mitral valve have recently been made. However, current knowledge of protein components in the normal human mitral valve is still limited and complicated by the low cellularity of this tissue and the presence of high abundant proteins from the extracellular matrix. We employed here an integrated proteomic approach to analyse the protein composition of the normal human mitral valve and reported confident identification of 422 proteins, some of which have not been previously described in this tissue. In particular, we described the ability of pre-MS separation technique based on liquid-phase IEF and SDS-PAGE to identify the largest number of proteins. These initial results provide a valuable basis for future studies aimed at analysing in depth the mitral valve protein composition and at investigating potential pathogenetic molecular mechanisms.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004397
Direct evidence of milk consumption from ancient human dental calculus, northern southwest Asia	This study investigated the consumption of milk products in the archaeological record, utilizing human dental calculus as a reservoir of dietary proteins from archaeological samples from across Eurasia. Protein extraction and generation of tryptic peptides from dental calculus was performed using a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol, modified for ancient samples, on 92 samples of archaeological dental calculus. Samples were extracted at three laboratories; the Functional Genomics Centre Zürich (FGCZ), the Centre for GeoGenetics at the National History Museum of Denmark, and BioArCh at the University of York. Sample extracts were sequenced (LC-MS/MS) using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (FGCZ), a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap and an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite (Central Proteomics Facility, Target Discovery Institute, Oxford).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001359

Endogenous Purification Reveals GREB1 as a Key Estrogen Receptor Regulatory Factor	Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) is the driving transcription factor in most breast cancers, and its associated proteins can influence drug response, but direct methods for identifying interacting proteins have been limited. We purified endogenous ER using an approach termed RIME (rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins) and discovered the interactome under agonist- and antagonist-liganded conditions in breast cancer cells, revealing transcriptional networks in breast cancer. The most estrogen-enriched ER interactor is GREB1, a potential clinical biomarker with no known function. GREB1 is shown to be a chromatin-bound ER coactivator and is essential for ER-mediated transcription, because it stabilizes interactions between ER and additional cofactors. We show a GREB1-ER interaction in three xenograft tumors, and using a directed protein-protein approach, we find GREB1-ER interactions in half of ER+ primary breast cancers. This finding is supported by histological expression of GREB1, which shows that GREB1 is expressed in half of ER+ cancers, and predicts good clinical outcome. These findings reveal an unexpected role for GREB1 as an estrogen-specific ER cofactor that is expressed in drug-sensitive contexts.        Additional information: All microarray data have been deposited in the GEO database with the accession number GSE37386. All ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the GEO database with the accession number GSE41561.         RawMSdata files were processed using Proteome Discoverer v.1.3 (Thermo Scientific). Processed files were searched against the SwissProt human database using the Mascot search engine version 2.3.0. Searches were done with tryptic specificity allowing up to one miscleavage and a tolerance on mass measurement of 10 ppm in MS mode and 0.6 Da for MS/MS ions. Structure modifications allowed were oxidized methionine, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues, which were searched as variable modifications. Using a reversed decoy database, false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 1%. Detailed results including peptide sequences, peptide scores, ion scores, expect values, and Mascot scores have been included in Table S1. SILAC data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v.1.3. This analysis only uses unique peptides for ratio analysis. The resulting fold-change ratios for proteins found in both replicates were then converted into log fold-change ratios as represented in the figures. In a few instances where protein ratios were absent due to signal from only one of the two channels, these were ranked highest in the log fold-change table following manual inspection of the raw data (MS and MS/MS) to confirm specificity to a single label.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000047

VHL Cancer -  Proteomic analysis of signaling network regulation in renal cell carcinomas with differential hypoxia-inducible factor-2α expression	The loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein function leads to highly vascular renal tumors characterized by an aggressive course of disease and refractoriness to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Loss of VHL in renal tumors also differs from tumors of other organs in that the oncogenic cascade is mediated by an increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) instead of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha).        MS/MS data generated by data dependent acquisition via the LTQ-FT were extracted by BioWorks version 3.3 and searched against a composite IPI human protein sequence database (IPI _human_v 3.73.par)  containing both forward and randomized sequences using Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search algorithm. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 15.0 ppm assuming trypsin as the digestion enzyme with the possibility of one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine, N-terminal protein acetylation, N-terminal peptide and lysine carbamoylation, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine were specified as variable modifications. The analysis of VHL-wt (Caki-2) human RCC and VHL-mut (786-O) cells was carried out from three independent, biological samples from each cell line (tryptic digests of Caki-2 and 786-O, respectively) and duplicate injections were made for each sample. Data processing was accomplished using two software tools: Scaffold (version Scaffold 3.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and Progenesis LC-MS (version 3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Scaffold was employed to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications from Mascot database searching. Initial peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [20]. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [21]. Protein identifications were accepted, if they reached greater than 99% probability and contained at least 2 identified unique peptides. These identification criteria typically established < 0.01% false discovery rate based on a decoy database search strategy at the protein level.        Extracted peptide intensities were evaluated with Progenesis LC-MS to obtain label-free relative quantification from the raw data files. The software created a single aggregate run based on LC retention time of each analysis to contain all MS data with distinguished peptide ions and, then, further feature outline maps were generated for detection and quantification of peptide ions from individual analyses using default program parameters. Peptide quantifications were performed by summing peak intensities followed by normalization, data filtering to retain only ions with positive charges (z) of two and three, and exporting peak lists to query against the IPI human protein sequence database using Mascot (see Database Search subsection above). Proteins were accepted as differentially expressed following analysis of variance (ANOVA, P<0.05), requiring at least a twofold change in expression and also passing validation by Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet using protein identifications from Scaffold.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000335

Quantification of cytokines secreted by primary human cells using MRM: evaluation of analytical parameters – shotgun secretome data of untreated HUVECs	The determination of secreted proteins may provide highly valuable information about cell functions. While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002212

Human urine proteome in overactive bladder syndorme	The aim of this study is analysis of urinary proteomic pattern in healthy people and patients suffering from OAB symptoms by means of mass spectrophotometry. Establishing characteristic protein profiles, qualitative and quantitative, for OAB will help to define specific protein marker and will allow to develop new investigative protocol enabling to discover at what stage of post-genetic changes urothelium cells change their proteomic profile causing OAB symptoms.  Patients will be divided into two groups: group A – OAB patients and group B – control group, without any urinary tract symptoms. All participants will be questionnaired with appropriate tools evaluating quality of life of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder diary. Urine samples will be taken twice with 7 day gap and then prepared for further evaluation with mass spectrophotometry. Mass spectrophotometry will be performed for all labeled samples with QExactive spectrophotometer. In order to provide maximal credibility and reliability of acquired data each sample will be managed in triplicate. Those result will be analyzed with specific statistical methods and final results will be correlated between the groups.  In long-term perspective results of this project will help to understand the underlying pathomechanisms of overactive blabber syndrome. In future those results will be applied for further research in OAB sufferers allowing for precise and objective diagnosis and prognosis. In our opinion it will also serve as a tool for estimations of treatment efficacy of new therapeutic methods. In consequence the project will allow us to create a unique toolkit, combining spectrophotometry, urinary proteomic pattern differences and quality of life correlated with OAB symptoms severity. It will enable to develop new perspectives for overactive bladder pathophysiology research and new therapeutic strategies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017799
Human POP analysis -  Proteomics of Uterosacral Ligament Connective Tissue from Women With and Without Pelvic Organ Prolapse	Purpose:  Damage to the uterosacral ligaments is an important contributor to uterine and vaginal prolapse.  The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in the uterosacral ligaments of women with and without pelvic organ prolapse and analyze their relationships to cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse.   Experimental Design:  Uterosacral ligament connective tissue from four patients with pelvic organ prolapse and four control women underwent iTRAQ analysis followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed proteins.  Differentially expressed proteins were valideated using western blot analysis.   Results:  A total of 1789 unique protein sequences were identified in the uterosacral ligament connective tissues.  88 proteins had expression levels that were significantly different between prolapse and control groups (≥1.2-fold). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated 14 differentially expressed proteins that were associated with "Connective Tissue Function". Among them, fibromodulin(FMOD), Collagen alpha-1 (XIV) chain(COL14A1), Calponin-1 (CNN-1), Tenascin (TNC), and Galectin-1(LGALS1 appeared most likely to play a role in the etiology of pelvic organ prolapse.  Conclusions and clinical relevence:  We identified at least 6 proteins not previously associated with the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse with biologic functions that suggest a plausible relationship to the disorder.  These results may be helpful for furthering our understanding of the  pathophysiological mechanisms of pelvic organ prolapse.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011467

• Clinical proteomics profiling for biomarker identification  among patients suffering with Indian Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis	Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a non-fatal dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. On the global scenario, PKDL in mainly restricted to distinct zones of South Asia (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) and East Africa, mainly Sudan. In India, the most prominent fatal form of leishmaniasis present is VL, affecting entirely the eastern region of the country. The clinical presentation of VL and PKDL differ substantially; where VL patients suffer from sustained fever, hepatospleenomegaly, weight loss and anemia, PKDL patients manifest dermal lesions in the form of macular, nodular and polymorphic.  Although, compared to VL, the mortality rate of PKDL is significantly lower, yet it is observed as a stigmatizing disease that brings a substantial socioeconomic burden, further intensified by a hesitancy of patients, to obtain treatment, or due to noncompliance. Lesions, especially the polymorphic forms, are parasite-rich, concluding that PKDL plays a crucial role in the anthroponotic transmission of VL. PKDL patients with Macular lesions, having comparatively lower parasitic load, and thus lacks detection sensitivity with standard techniques like rK39 (73% sensitivity), Leishmanin skin test (54% sensitivity) and Histopathological studies with patients’ skin biopsy sample (7-33% sensitivity) and is often misdiagnosed as Vitiligo cases. In order to completely eliminate Kala-azar in Southeast Asia, proper identification of various routes of the disease is essential, which could efficiently distinguish between cured PKDL and active PKDL as well as active PKDL from other cross disease like Leprosy and Vitiligo. Till now very less work has been done towards biomarker identification for PKDL from patients’ plasma. Most of the methods for disease identification are based on highly invasive tissue biopsy followed by PCR/qPCR. Recently investigations from our group have demonstrated the presence of novel glycoproteins in the circulating immune complexes (CICs) from serum, as biomarkers for early identification of PKDL patients. An Immune complex (IC), sometimes called an antigen-antibody complex, is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any number of responses, including complement deposition, opsonisation, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Accumulation of ICs leads to a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory effects, including activation of the complement cascade and induction of cytokine secretion. These complexes may also be deposited in tissues and vessel walls, leading to inflammation, tissue damage and, ultimately, disease manifestations. Immune complexes also affect disease progression and outcome in various disorders through the induction of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study we hypothesize that the CICs’ proteome is altered among PKDL patients with different dermal manifestations (Macular and Polymorphic) as compared to Cured individuals (CR) and Healthy controls (HI). The aim of this current study is to identify differentially expressed CIC proteomic profile among different forms PKDL patients as compared to HI. The differential protein expression of specific unique peptide fragments, representing specific proteins, could be used as diagnostic biomarkers in early detection of both Macular and Polymorphic PKDL cases. In this prospective study, we included PKDL patients with Macular and/or Polymorphic lesion, Cured individuals and HI. Among the enrolled patients, blood samples were collected from 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Macular lesions, 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Polymorphic lesions, 12 Cured individuals previously suffering from PKDL and 12 Healthy individuals; collected during the period of 2015-2016, stored at -80°C. Next the CICs were purified from PKDL patients’ plasma and LC MS/MS analysis was performed using Q-ExactivePlusOrbitrap mass spectrometer. This work for the first time revealed the differential CICs proteome profile among different forms of PKDL patients as compared to their Cured and Healthy counterparts.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD012960
Network of interactions between ZIKA virus non-structural proteins and human host proteins	The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus and can be transmitted through an infected mosquito bite or through human-to-human interaction by sexual activity, blood transfusion, breastfeeding or perinatal exposure. After the 2015-2016 outbreak in Brazil, a strong link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly emerged. ZIKV specifically targets human neural progenitor cells, suggesting that proteins encoded by ZIKV bind and inactivate host cell proteins leading to microcephaly. Here, we present a systematic annotation of interactions between human proteins and the seven non-structural ZIKV proteins corresponding to a Brazilian isolate. The interaction network was generated by combining tandem-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry with yeast two-hybrid screens. We identified 150 human proteins, involved in distinct biological processes, as interactors to ZIKV non-structural proteins. Our interacting network is composed of proteins that have been previously associated with microcephaly in human genetic disorders and/or animal models. This study builds on previously published interacting networks of ZIKV and genes related to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly to generate a catalog of human cellular targets of ZIKV proteins implicated in processes related to microcephaly in humans. Collectively, this data can be used as a resource for future characterization of ZIKV infection biology and help create a basis for the discovery of drugs which may disrupt the interaction and reduce the health damage to the fetus.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014961
PTENa/b paradoxically promote carcinogenesis through WDR5-H3K4me3 axis	PTEN, a widely investigated tumor suppressor, has at least two longer translational variants, PTEN and . However, the regulation and precise roles of endogenous PTEN/ in tumorigenesis remain greatly unknown. Here we show that USP9X and FBXW11 selectively regulate the stability of PTEN/ but not PTEN proteins by deubiqitination and ubiquitination respectively. USP9X promotes and FBXW11 suppresses tumorigenesis mediated by PTEN/. In contrast to the current paradigm for PTEN as a tumor suppressor, PTEN/ promote tumorigenesis of cancer cells in a phosphatase-independent manner. Mechanistically, PTEN/ localized in the nucleus regulate expressions of tumor-promoting genes such as NOTCH3 in the similar way as the H3K4 presenter WDR5. Further, PTEN/ but not PTEN directly interact with WDR5 to promote trimethylation of H3K4 and maintain a tumor-promoting signature. Taken together, our results indicate that PTEN/ are a double-edged sword for carcinogenesis, suggesting that reinterpretation of the importance of PTEN gene in carcinogenesis is warranted.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013196
Multiplexed thiol reactivity profiling for target discovery of electrophilic natural products	Electrophilic groups, such as Michael acceptors, expoxides, are common motifs in natural products (NPs). Electrophilic NPs can act through covalent modification of cysteinyl thiols on functional proteins, and exhibit potent cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory/cancer activities. Here we describe a new chemoproteomic strategy, termed multiplexed thiol reactivity profiling (MTRP), and its use in target discovery of electrophilic NPs. We demonstrate the utility of MTRP by identifying cellular targets of gambogic acid, an electrophilic NP that is currently under evaluation in clinical trials as anticancer agent. Moreover, MTRP enables simultaneous comparison of seven structurally diversified -unsaturated -lactones, which provides insights into the relative proteomic reactivity and target preference of diverse structural scaffolds coupled to a common electrophilic motif and reveals various potential druggable targets with liganded cysteines. We anticipate that this new method for thiol reactivity profiling in a multiplexed manner will find broad application in redox biology and drug discovery.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007575

Proteomic profiles of  synovial fluids derived from autologous chondrocyte implantation surgery	The pathology of failure in currently used biological treatments (cell therapies and microfracture) for cartilage repair or early osteoarthritis (OA) is poorly understood. We aimed to identify a reliable panel of biological predictors, present in synovial fluid, which can be used in the preoperative setting to optimise patient selection and therapy efficacy. The-long term aim is to reduce the number of patients who progress to end-stage OA and require knee replacement by making earlier, less invasive treatments more effective. In this first stage, we have taken synovial fluid aspirates from patients undergoing autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) at our centre in Oswestry, UK. Synovial fluids (SFs) were obtained from 14 ACI responders (mean Lysholm improvement of 33 (17-54)) and 13 non-responders (mean Lysholm decrease of 14 (4-46)) at the two stages of surgery (cartilage harvest and chondrocyte implantation). Dynamic range compression of synovial fluids coupled with label-free quantification mass spectrometry (MS), was used in an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers of ACI success or failure and to investigate the biological pathways involved in the clinical response to ACI.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005220
Phospho-iTRAQ -  Phospho-iTRAQ: Assessing Isobaric Labels for the Large-Scale Study Of Phosphopeptide Stoichiometry	One of the most extensively studied protein modifications is phosphorylation, a reversible posttranslational modification (PTM) with a central role in a broad range of cellular processes such as cell metabolism, homeostasis, transcription and apoptosis. Due to their transient character, phosphorylations initiate and propagate signal transduction pathways, making these fundamental to inter- and intracellular communication. Detection of phosphorylation is nevertheless challenging considering the dynamic regulation, low stoichiometry and heterogeneous character of the phosphosites. Numerous dedicated phosphoproteomics workflows have therefore been developed in order to unravel phosphorylation networks and the activity of their modulating enzymes. In these workflows, phosphopeptides are typically enriched prior to mass spectrometry analysis to remove the strong background interference caused by the bulk of non-phosphorylated peptides (3). Apart from requiring thorough optimization and a corresponding high level of expertise of the analyst however, enrichment is also responsible for sample loss and limited quantitation accuracy (4). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis is furthermore confounded by low ionization efficiency and inferior fragmentation of phosphopeptides. Conventional MS/MS analysis with collision-induced dissociation predominantly results in the neutral loss of the phosphate group, leading to poor sequence coverage due to reduced backbone fragmentation. An additional stage of fragmentation in MS3 or the use of alternative fragmentation technologies such as higher energy C-trap dissociation or electron transfer dissociation can partially facilitate the detection and identification of phosphopeptides (5, 6).  In order to draw accurate biological conclusions it is mandatory to obtain quantitative information on the phospho-modifications. Most quantitative approaches aim to elucidate the relative phosphorylation changes between samples, employing direct label-free comparisons of phospho-enriched fractions, or metabolic or chemical labeling methods such as SILAC, iTRAQ or tandem mass tag (TMT) (4, 6, 7). Such methods however, forego the investigation of phosphorylation stoichiometry, also known as occupancy, since such analysis requires the simultaneous monitoring of the unphosphorylated counterpart (8).  One interesting labeling strategy that is specifically designed to quantify occupancy circumvents the common difficulties of standard phosphopeptide detection by focusing on the non-phosphorylated counterparts of the phosphopeptides (11). Herein, a peptide sample is briefly split in two identical parts which are differentially labeled, preceding a phosphatase treatment of one part and mock-treatment of the other. Immediately afterwards the two parts are recombined for the subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Dephosphorylation of a phosphopeptide will  induce a 79.979 mass shift resulting in a skewed label ratio in the unphosphorylated peptide’s reporter region which now specifies the phosphorylation stoichiometry (12). Although the principle has been described previously (12-19), only one phosphatase-based workflow was adapted specifically for the large-scale study of a complete lysate whereby known phosphopeptides present in a database were quantified by isotopic labels (20). Here we extend for the first time the isobaric tag equivalent of this approach for the large-scale quantitative phospho-analysis of complex mixtures. The technique was validated on three different instrument platforms on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated HeLa cells (23). We discuss a novel data analysis approach for the discovery of high stoichiometry phosphopeptides in complex peptide mixtures and present a way to interpret the sizable dataset without matching the peptide identifications to a phospho-database. Because all peptides and not only the phosphorylated fraction of the proteome is measured in this approach, instruments with high-speed acquisition capabilities and adequate resolution for accurate reporter quantitation are indispensable. Still, because of the minimal technical variation that is introduced throughout the workflow (as for Wu et.al. (20)), implementation of extensive fractionation and purification steps such as protein gel-electrophoresis and 2DLC at the peptide level allows for more in-depth coverage of the (phospho) proteome. What makes this approach even more attractive, is that the iTRAQ multiplexing allows for a replicate measurement within one experiment, creating a new data analysis workflow that meets the stringent requirements of peptide quantitation. All three instrument panels were able to annotate a large set of known phosphoproteins. Extending the latter sample fractionation and using novel methodologies to avoid dilution of reporter ratios in MSMS will allow for the annotation of increasing numbers of phosphopeptide with increasingly low stoichometries in the future.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001574

N-Linked Glycoprotein Profiles of Human Breast Basal Malignant Cell Lines	Secreted proteins and transmembrane proteins with extracellular domains are frequently glycosylated; this group of proteins includes those that participate in the various intercellular junctions and signaling pathways of an epithelium.  In this study we characterized the differences in glycoprotein expression between claudin-low and other breast cell lines using a dataset of 26 breast cell lines in which the glycoproteins were identified and quantitated by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry.  Our goals are to characterize the glycoproteome of a set of claudin-low lines, compare them to basal, luminal and non-malignant cells and to identify drugs that may be especially effective on these cell lines. These nine basal malignant breast cells (HCC1143, HCC1395, HCC1937, HCC1954, HCC38, HCC70, MDAMB468, SUM149PT and SUM229PE) data are a part of 26 breast cell lines we analyzed.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005295
Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - cytoplasmic proteins of elderly B cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006570
Quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of glioblastoma stem cells	Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant brain tumors with poor prognosis and their development and progression are known to be driven by glioblastoma stem cells. Although glioblastoma stem cells lose their cancer stemness properties during cultivation in serum-containing medium, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating signaling alteration in relation to reduction of stemness. In order to elucidate the global phosphorylation-related signaling events, we performed a SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of serum-induced dynamics in glioblastoma stem cells established from the tumor tissues of the patient. Among a total of 2,876 phosphorylation sites on 1,584 proteins identified in our analysis, 732 phosphorylation sites on 419 proteins were regulated through the alteration of stem cell characteristics.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002614
Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - tumor-near tissue sections	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001324

Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - cytoplasmic proteins of inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001419
Proteogenomic Landscape of Squamous Cell Lung Cancer 1: Digestion QC with DIA LC-MS/MS	We report an integrated analysis incorporating DNA copy number analyses, somatic exon mutations, mRNA expression via RNA-sequencing, and shotgun mass spectrometry analysis of protein abundance in 108 surgically resected squamous cell lung cancers (SCC) with accompanying clinical outcome, evaluation of tumor pathology, and other clinically relevant data.  We identified three major subtypes of SCC at the proteomic level, with two groups associated with inflammation/immune response or oxidation-reduction biology.  Inflamed tumors could be further sub-classified based on neutrophil infiltration or antigen presentation proteomes and reflected patterns of infiltrating immune cells.  No gene mutations, mRNA signatures, or proteomic subclasses were associated with outcomes; however, the presence of B-cell rich tertiary lymph node structures could be associated with better patient outcomes.  By integrating our proteogenomic data with publicly available RNA interference screen data, we identified TP63, PSAT1, and AKR1C3 as vulnerabilities in SCC, particularly in the redox proteomic group.  This cohort and its deep molecular data serves as an important resource to better understand biology and targets associated with SCC.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010357

Changes in the Membrane-Associated Proteins of Exosomes Released from Human Macrophages after Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection - Biotinylated	Tuberculosis (TB) is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide. One obstacle hindering the elimination of TB is our lack of understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Exosomes, naturally loaded with microbial molecules, are circulating markers of TB. Changes in the host protein composition of exosomes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells have not been described, can contribute to our understanding of the disease process, and serve as a direct source of biomarkers or as capture targets to enrich for exosomes containing microbial molecules. Here, the protein composition of exosomes from Mtb-infected and uninfected THP-1-derived macrophages was evaluated by tandem-mass-spectrometry and differences in protein abundances were assessed. Our results show that infection with Mtb leads to significant changes in the protein composition of exosomes. Specifically, 41 proteins were significantly more abundant in exosomes from Mtb-infected cells; 63% of these were predicted to be membrane associated. Thus, we used a novel biotinylation strategy to verify protein localization, and confirmed the localization of some of these proteins in the exosomal membrane. Our findings reveal another important scenario where Mtb could be influencing changes in host cells that unveil new features of the host-pathogen interaction and may also be exploited as a source of biomarkers for TB.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010659

Fascin Controls Metastatic Colonization and Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation by Remodeling Mitochondrial Actin Filaments/The mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase is required for the self-renewal of cancer stem-like cell in lung adenocarcinoma	Project 1: The deregulation of the actin cytoskeleton has been extensively studied in metastatic dissemination. However, the post-dissemination role of the actin cytoskeleton dysregulation is poorly understood. Here we report that fascin, an actin-bundling protein, promotes lung cancer metastatic colonization by augmenting metabolic stress resistance and mitochondrial OXPHOS. Fascin is directly recruited to mitochondria under metabolic stress to stabilize mitochondrial actin filaments (mtF-actin). Using unbiased metabolomics and proteomics approaches, we discovered that fascin-mediated mtF-actin remodeling promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS by increasing the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I. Mechanistically, fascin and mtF-actin controls the homeostasis of mtDNA to promote mitochondrial OXPHOS. The disruption of mtFactin abrogates fascin-mediated lung cancer metastasis. Conversely, restoration of mitochondrial respiration using yeast NDI1 in fascin depleted cancer cells is able to rescue lung metastasis. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated actin cytoskeleton in metastatic lung cancer could be targeted to rewire mitochondrial metabolism and to prevent metastatic recurrence. Project 2: There is a pool of mitochondrial dNTP in the cell maintained by the mitochondrial deoxynucleoside salvage pathway and dedicated for the mtDNA homeostasis in slow-cycling  and post-mitotic cells.  The role of the mitochondrial deoxynucleoside salvage pathway in tumor initiation and progression is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK), a rate-limiting enzyme in the mitochondrial deoxynucleoside salvage pathway, in the self-renewal of lung adenocarcinoma cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Our data support that DGUOK overexpression strongly correlates with cancer progression and patient survival. The depletion of DGUOK robustly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth, metastasis and CSC self-renewal. Mechanistically, DGUOK is required for the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I and mitochondrial OXPHOS, which in turn regulates CSC self-renewal through AMPK-YAP1 signaling. The restoration of mitochondrial OXPHOS in DGUOK depleted lung cancer cells using NDI1, a single subunit yeast NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase, was able to rescue AMPK-YAP1 signaling and CSC stemness. Genetic targeting of DGUOK using doxycycline-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 was able to markedly induce tumor regression. Our findings reveal a novel role for mitochondrial dNTP metabolism in lung cancer tumor growth and progression, and implicate that the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide salvage pathway could be potentially targeted to prevent CSC-mediated therapy resistance and metastatic recurrence.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014753
Single-cell census of the colonic epithelium reveals goblet cell drivers of barrier breakdown in inflammatory bowel disease	Colonic epithelial cells facilitate host-microbe interactions to control mucosal immunity, and they also coordinate recycling and forming the mucus barrier. Epithelial barrier breakdown underpins inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, we do not know the specific contributions of each epithelial cell subtype to this process. Here, we profiled single colonic epithelial cells in health and IBD. Our results identified previously unknown subtypes and crypt gradients of progenitors, colonocytes and goblet cells. We also revealed a novel specialized metal ion storage and chloride secretory cell. In IBD, we discovered a unique cluster of disease associated goblet cells that remodels the barrier. We found downregulated WFDC2, a novel goblet cell expressing anti-protease that inhibited bacterial growth. Our in vivo studies demonstrated WFDC2 preserved tight junction integrity and prevented commensal invasion and mucosal inflammation. We delineate markers and transcriptional states, identify a new colonic epithelial cell and uncover fundamental principles of epithelial plasticity and barrier breakdown in IBD. Thus, our study reveals new therapeutic targets and disease-related mechanisms in IBD	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011655

c-Src functionality controls self-renewal, tumorigenicity and glucose metabolism in breast cancer stem cells	Deregulation of Src kinases is associated with cancer. We previously showed that SrcDN conditional expression in MCF7 cells diminished tumorigenesis and causes tumor regression in mice. However, it remained unclear whether SrcDN affected breast cancer stem cell functionality or it reduced tumor mass. Here, we address this question by isolating an enriched population of BCSCs (ESA+-CD44+-CD24-) and the tumor-differentiated cells (ESA+-CD44+-CD24+) from MCF7-Tet-On-SrcDN. ESA+-CD44+-CD24- grew in suspension forming mammospheres, and producing tumors in nude mice, while ESA+-CD44+-CD24+ were poorly/non-tumorigenic. Doxycycline-induction of SrcDN inhibited BCSC tumorigenesis, selfrenewal, and stem-cell markers expression. SrcDN significantly inhibited SFE, and stem-cell markers expression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT cells. Inducible depletion of c-Src caused similar effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF7-Tet-On-SrcDN derived mammospheres SrcDN-induction inhibited expression, and activity of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in diminished glucose consumption and lactate production, which restricted Warburg effect. Thus, c-Src functionality is important for breast cancer stem cell maintenance and renewal, tumorigenicity, and stem cell transcription factor expression, effects linked to glucose metabolism reduction.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017789
Human exosome proteome -  Human urinary exosomes as innate immune effectors	Proteomics study of human urine exosomes. This data describes the proteomic complement of the human exosomal urine fraction from 10 healthy volunteers (5 male, 5 female) aged 23 to 36 years. 50 µg protein from each sample were fragmented on a 4%/12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and LC-MS/MS was performed using an Eksigent NanoLC-1D Plus (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA) HPLC system and an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Peptides from each gel segment were analysed twice: (1) with a dynamic exclusion list and (2) a fixed exclusion list for the abundant protein uromodulin which was superimposed on a dynamic exclusion. MS data were processed using SEQUEST Bioworks Browser (version 3.3.1 SP1, ThermoFisher) to generate MS/MS peak lists.

Arctigenin attenuates diabetic kidney disease through the activation of PP2A in podocytes	Arctigenin (ATG) is a major component of Fructus Arctii, which as a traditional herbal remedy reduced proteinuria in diabetic patients. However, whether ATG specifically provided renoprotection in DKD was not known. Here we report that ATG administration is sufficient to attenuate proteinuria and podocyte injury in mouse models of diabetes. Transcriptomic analysis of diabetic mouse glomeruli showed that cell adhesion and inflammation are two key pathways affected by ATG treatment, and mass spectrometry analysis identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as one of the top ATG-interacting proteins in renal cells. Enhanced PP2A activity by ATG reduces p65 NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response and high glucose-induced migration in cultured podocytes via its interaction with Drebrin-1. Importantly, podocyte-specific Pp2a deletion in mice exacerbates DKD injury and abrogates the ATG-mediated renoprotection. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate a renoprotective mechanism of ATG via PP2A activation and establish PP2A as a potential target for DKD progression.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014976

Here we discover the extensive mixed tailing in the transcripts of two distinct DNA viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and their striking similarity in the mechanism to exploit the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex. TAIL-seq analyses of HBV and HCMV RNAs revealed that TENT4A and TENT4B are responsible for the mixed tailing and protection of viral poly(A) tails. By fCLIP-seq on HBV-producing cells, we found that the HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (PRE) is the primary site of the TENT4 interactome. A hairpin with a CNGGN-type pentaloop in the PRE is critical for TENT4-dependent regulation. Unexpectedly, HCMV also utilizes a similar pentaloop hairpin, an interesting example of convergent evolution. We further found that the CNGGN pentaloop is recognized by the SAM domain-containing ZCCHC14 protein which in turn recruits TENT4 to stabilize viral transcripts. Altogether, our study reveals the action mechanism of PRE that has been widely used to enhance gene expression, and introduces the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex as the key host factor and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD018061
Phosphopattern Predicts CK2 Substrate, HMGA1, as a Drug Resistant Target for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. Known mechanisms for EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification did not observe in the resistant cells, PC9/gef. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs in PC9/gef cells. Here, we used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to globally profile the basal phosphoproteome and proteome of a panel of TKI sensitive PC9, TKI resistant PC9/gef and TKI dose-dependent PC9/gef NSCLC cell lines. For phosphorylation level, we identified 5844 phosphorylation sites from 4612 phosphopeptides of 1548 proteins. For protein level, we identified 3835 proteins. Most of the quantitatively change is from phosphorylation whereas most of the protein level is unchanged. Among these big datasets, there is a phosphopattern of phosphopeptides presented up-regulated in resistant cells but no response to further gefitinib treatment; we proposed this group could regulate drug resistance. By motif analysis, these phosphopeptides mapped to the corresponding kinases, CK2, as the drug resistant kinase. Network analysis showed that CK2 directed interacting with 10 proteins. Among these proteins, we found that HMGA1 is the substrate protein to CK2. By biochemical evidence, we discovered that CK2 could regulate cell death in TKI-resistant cells. Furthermore, we found that HMGA1 for the first time could be the potential drug resistant target to reverse the drug resistance in PC9/gef cells. The results provide new insights into HMGA1 as the drug resistant target through the cellular signaling networks associated with the TKI-induced drug resistant NSCLCs.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000861

Characterization of secretomes from brain microvascular endothelial cells after ischemia	The human immortalized brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 is considered an in vitro model of the blood-brain-barrier. We aimed to characterize changes in the secretome of hCMEC/D3 subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) by SILAC, in order to identify new proteins involved in ischemia-triggered blood-brain-barrier disruption and test their potential as blood biomarkers for ischemic stroke diagnosis. After SILAC analysis, 19 proteins were found differentially secreted between OGD and normoxia/normoglycemia conditions (Fold Change>|1.4| and peptide count≥2). Protein folding and nucleic acid binding were the main molecular functions and epithelial adherens junctions and aldosterone signaling appeared as the main canonical pathways represented by OGD-secreted proteins. ANXA1, CLUS, IGFBP2, PRDX3, TIMP2 and COL1A2 were replicated by western blotting in 9 independent cell cultures. Five replicated proteins were analyzed in human serum samples of 38 ischemic stroke patients compared to 18 stroke-mimicking conditions and 18 healthy controls by ELISA. IGFBP2 showed increased blood levels when strokes were compared with stroke-mimicking patients (p<0.1).  In conclusion, we characterized changes in the secretome of hCMEC/D3 after an ischemic insult and highlighted some candidates to become biomarkers for ischemic stroke diagnosis related to blood-brain-barrier disruption.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002292

Proteomic analyses reveal that loss of TDP-43 affects RNA processing and intracellular transport	Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a predominantly nuclear, ubiquitously expressed RNA and DNA-binding protein. It recognises and binds to UG repeats and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and microRNA metabolism. TDP-43 is essential in early embryonic development but accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It is not known yet whether cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are toxic or protective but they are often associated with a loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus and neurodegeneration may be caused by a loss of normal TDP-43 function or a gain of toxic function. Here we present a proteomic study to analyse the effect of loss of TDP-43 on the proteome. Our results indicate that TDP-43 is an important regulator of RNA metabolism and intracellular transport. We show that Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (Dnmt3a) and chromogranin B (CgB) are downregulated upon TDP-43 knockdown. Subsequently, transportin 1 level is increased as a result of RanBP1 depletion. Improper regulation of these proteins and the subsequent disruption of cellular processes may play a role in the pathogenesis of the TDP-43 proteinopathies ALS and FTLD.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001668
Proteomic profiling of Burkholderia thailandensis during host infection	Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei are the causative agents of melioidosis and glanders, respectively, and are often fatal to humans and animals. Owing to the high fatality rate, potential for spread by aerosolization, and the lack of efficacious therapeutics, B. pseudomallei and B. mallei are considered biothreat agents of concern. In this study, we investigate the proteome of Burkholderia thailandensis, a closely related surrogate for the two more virulent Burkholderia species, during infection of host cells, and compare to that of B. thailandensis in culture. Studying the proteome of intracellular Burkholderia spp. is expected to reveal molecular mechanisms of intracellular survival and host immune evasion; but proteomic profiling of intracellular Burkholderia is challenging. Proteomic analyses of intracellular bacteria are typically hindered by the overwhelming host protein content recovered from infected cultures. To address this problem, we have applied bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to B. thailandensis, enabling the enrichment of newly expressed bacterial proteins from virtually any growth condition, most importantly intracellular contexts. In this study, we show that B. thailandensis proteins were selectively labeled and efficiently enriched from infected host cells using BONCAT. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to label bacteria in situ by fluorescent tagging. Finally, we present a global proteomic profile of B. thailandensis as it infects host cells and a list of proteins that are differentially regulated in infection conditions as compared to bacterial monoculture. Among the identified proteins are quorum sensing regulated genes as well as homologs to previously identified virulence factors. This method provides a powerful tool to study the molecular processes during Burkholderia infection, a much-needed addition to the Burkholderia molecular toolbox.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011042
PLASMA biomarkers of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis	The aim of the current study is to find plasma-based biomarker candidates for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

EndoC-betaH3 Cell FANCA Protein Interactions Regulated by Glucose Stimulation	Hyperinsulinemia affects 72% of Fanconi anemia (FA) patients and an additional 25% experience lowered glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the dysfunction of FA pancreas β cells is unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify previously unexplored roles of FA proteins in the glucose responsive human pancreas β cell line EndoC-βH3 using a mass spectrometry-based protein interaction analysis of endogenous FANCA. This study reveals glucose stimulation-dependent changes in the FANCA interaction network indicative of the DNA damage response (DDR) through interactions with other FA proteins. We identify protein interactions with FANCA related to β cell insulin secretion.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010589

CF sputum LC-MSMS -  Proteomic profile of cystic fibrosis sputum cells in adults chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and involves chronic infection by a destructive microbiota and perturbed innate and adaptive immune responses. Tissue damage is considered to be mediated mostly by proteases, but other bacterial and host factors may also play a role. To determine the presence of potentially injurious proteins we employed semi-quantitative Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology to identify sputum cellular proteins with consistently altered expression in CF compared to healthy controls. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Gene Ontology functions, protein abundance and correlation with lung function were used to infer their clinical significance. The CF proteome exhibited differential expression of proteins relating to Rho family small GTPase activity, immune cell movement and activation, generation of reactive oxygen species and dysregulation of cell death and proliferation. Compositional breakdown established neutrophil extracellular trap proteins as the consistently most abundant cellular proteins detected, while a further 13 biologically relevant proteins were found to correlate negatively with lung function. These findings expand the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying CF lung disease and identify sputum cell proteins which might be useful as markers of disease status, prognostic indicators, stratification determinants for treatment prescription or as therapeutic targets.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001985
Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 interactors	Identification of interactors is a major attempt in cell biology. Not only protein-protein but also protein-carbohydrate interactions are of high relevance for signal transduction in biological systems. Here we aim to identify novel interacting binding partners for the β-galactoside-binding proteins Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3) in context of the eye disease proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is one of the most common failures after retinal detachment surgeries and is characterized by the migration, adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and the subsequent formation of sub- and epiretinal fibrocellular membranes. Gal-1 and Gal-3 bind in a dose- and carbohydrate-dependent manner to mesenchymal RPE cells and inhibit cellular processes like attachment and spreading. Yet knowledge about glycan-dependent interactors of Gal-1 and Gal-3 on RPE cells is very limited, although this is a prerequisite to unravel the influence of galectins on distinct cellular processes in RPE cells. In this approach, we identified by galectin pull-down experiments and quantitative proteomic screening 131 Galectin-3 and 15 Galectin-1 interactors. They mainly play a role in multiple binding processes and are mostly membrane proteins. Here we focused on two novel identified interactors of Gal-1 and Gal-3 in the context of PVR: the low-density lipoprotein receptor LRP1 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta PDGFRB. We observed crosslinking and lattice formation of exogenous Gal-1 and Gal-3 with LRP1/PDGFRB and ITGB1 on the cell surface of human RPE cells. Weaker binding of Gal-1 and Gal-3 on these interactors and no lattice formation on the cell surface was seen, when complex-type-N-glycosylation was inhibited by treatment of the cells with Kifunensine. In conclusion, the identified specific glycoprotein ligands for Gal-1 and Gal-3 give us new insights in the highly specific binding of galectins to dedifferentiated RPE cells and the resulting prevention of PVR-associated cellular events.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005461
Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - cytoplasmic proteins of inflammatory stimulated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003407
Complementary Phosphoproteomic Approaches Link IL-23R Downstream Signaling with Metabolic Adaptation in Lymphocytes	Interleukin (IL)-23 mediated signal transduction represents a major molecular mechanism underlying the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, emerging evidence supports the role of IL-23-driven Th17 cells in inflammation. Components of the IL-23 signalling pathway, such as IL23R, JAK2 and STAT3, have been characterised, but elements unique to this network as compared to other interleukins have not been readily addressed. In this study, we have undertaken a multi-stage phosphoproteomics approach to better characterise downstream signalling events. To this end, we performed and compared phosphopeptide and phosphoprotein enrichment methodologies after activation of T lymphocytes by IL-23. We demonstrate the complementary nature of the two phosphor-enrichment approaches by maximising the capture of phosphorylation events. A total of 8069 unique phosphopeptides (containing 8344 unique sites), and 4317 unique phosphorylated proteins were identified, amongst which STAT3, PKM2, CDK6 and LASP-1 clearly showed induction of specific phosphorylation sites that were not readily observed after IL-2 stimulation. Interestingly, we observed subsequent translocation of STAT3 and PKM2 to the nucleus as well as increased phosphorylation especially of the nuclear portion at ~30 min after IL-23 stimulation, suggesting a wide range of cellular responses including proliferation and metabolic adaptation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002990
Human Cdc14A is phosphorylated by Cdk1 at early mitosis	Cdc14 enzymes compose a family of highly conserved phosphatases that are present in a wide range of organisms, including yeast and humans, and that preferentially reverse the phosphorylation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (Cdk) substrates. The budding yeast Cdc14 orthologue has essential functions in the control of late mitosis and cytokinesis. In mammals, however, the two Cdc14 homologues, Cdc14A and Cdc14B, do not play a prominent role in controlling late mitotic events, suggesting that some Cdc14 functions are not conserved across species. Moreover, in yeast, Cdc14 is regulated by changes in its subcellular location and by phosphorylation events. In contrast, little is known about the regulation of human Cdc14 phosphatases. Here, we have studied how the human Cdc14A orthologue is regulated during the cell cycle. We found that Cdc14A is phosphorylated on Ser411, Ser453 and Ser549 by Cdk1 early in mitosis and becomes dephosphorylated during late mitotic stages. Interestingly, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that, unlike in yeast, Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of human Cdc14A did not control its catalytic activity but likely modulated its interaction with other proteins in early mitosis. These findings point to differences in Cdk1-mediated mechanisms of regulation between human and yeast Cdc14 orthologues.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009481
Extracellular matrix analysis of human keloid scars	Fibrosis is vaguely described as connective tissue deposition that can be excessive in pathological conditions. This suggests a quantitative spectrum of fibrosis wherein there can be more or less extracellular matrix (ECM), which in the context of a repairing skin wound could reflect the range from normal scar to keloid. This depiction, however, does not encompass the potential qualitative differences between normal and pathological scars. In keloids, the markedly different physical (hard and dense) and histological (hyalinization) characteristics compared to normal scars indicate an altered and inappropriate matrix, rather than simply too much. With this quantitative discovery-based proteomics we provide a thorough molecular description of keloid lesions relative to normal scars, which is an essential step towards our understanding of this problem.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015057
A unified protocol for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from archaeological dental calculus	Archaeological materials are a finite resource, and efforts should be made to minimize destructive analyses. This can be achieved by using protocols combining extraction of several lines of evidence, which decreases the material needed for analyses while maximizing the information yield. Archaeological dental calculus is a source of several different types of biomolecules, as well as microfossils, and can tell us about the human host, microbiome, diet, and even occupational activities. Here, we present a unified protocol allowing for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from archaeological dental calculus. We evaluate the protocol on dental calculus from a range of ages and estimated preservation states, and compare it against standard DNA-only and protein-only protocols. We find that most aspects of downstream analyses are unaffected by the unified protocol, although minor shifts in the recovered proteome can be detected. Protein recovery depends on both the amount of starting material and choice of extraction protocol, whereas DNA recovery is significantly lowered through the unified protocol. However, DNA recovery from dental calculus is generally very high, and we found no differences in DNA fragment characteristics or taxonomic profile. In conclusion, the unified protocol allows for simultaneous extraction of two complementary lines of evidence from archaeological dental calculus without compromising downstream analyses, thereby minimizing the need for destructive analysis of this finite resource.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015817

Down-regulation of collagen hydroxylation in colorectal liver metastasis	Collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix, is significantly upregulated in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) compared to liver tissue. Expression levels of specific collagen types in CRLM resemble those in colorectal cancer (CRC) and colon tissue. We investigated whether the collagen hydroxylation pattern from the primary tumor also migrates with the metastatic tumor. The degree of collagen alpha-1(I) hydroxylation in colon, CRC, liver, and CRLM tissue in the same individuals (n=14) was studied with mass spectrometry. The degree of hydroxylation was investigated in 36 collagen alpha-1(I) peptides, which covered 54% of the triple helical region. The average degree of hydroxylation in liver tissue was similar to that in colon tissue. The overall degree of hydroxylation was significantly lower (9% +/- 14%) in CRC tissue and also significantly lower (12% +/-22%) in CRLM tissue compared to colon or liver tissue. Still, in previous research of liver and CRLM enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation were found to be upregulated, whereas P4HB (4-prolyl hydroxylase beta unit) was downregulated. Furthermore, 11 peptides are present with a specific number of hydroxylations that are significantly different between CRLM and liver tissue; these peptides could be candidates for the detection of CRLM. For one of these eleven peptides, a matching naturally occurring peptide in urine has been identified as being significantly different between patients suffering from CRLM and healthy controls. We conclude that the degree of hydroxylation in CRC and CRLM tumor tissue is in general significantly downregulated in comparison to healthy colon and liver tissue. The hydroxylation pattern in CRLM resemble partly the pattern in liver, primary colorectal cancer and colon.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015015
ER chemical proteomics with ER-localizable reactive molecules	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that performs a variety of essential cellular functions via interactions with other organelles. Despite its important role, chemical tools for profiling the composition and dynamics of ER proteins remain very limited because of the labile nature of these proteins. Here, we developed ER-localizable reactive molecules (called ERMs) as tools for ER-focused chemical proteomics. ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology. Our results demonstrated that ERM-based chemical proteomics provides a powerful tool for labeling and profiling ER-related proteins in living cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011618

Proteomic analysis of neutrophil extracellular traps (healthy control, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus)_C4PR_LIV	Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) are chromatin-derived extracellular structures that are expelled from neutrophils in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli. NET DNA structures are decorated with proteins including histones, myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase. NETs are implicated in the development of auto-immunity in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through the externalisation of intracellular neoepitopes e.g. dsDNA and nuclear proteins in SLE and citrullinated peptides in RA. The aim of this work was to use quantitative proteomics to identify and measure NET proteins produced by neutrophils from healthy individuals, and from patients with RA and SLE.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011796
Stable isotope labeling of phosphoproteins for large-scale  phosphorylation rate determination	Signals that control response to stimuli and cellular function are transmitted through dynamic phosphorylation of thousands of proteins by protein kinases. Many techniques have been developed to study phosphorylation dynamics, including several mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. Over the last few decades, substantial developments have been made in MS techniques for the large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, all of the current MS-based techniques for quantifying protein phosphorylation dynamics rely on the measurement of changes in peptide abundance levels and many methods suffer from low confidence in phosphopeptide identification due to poor fragmentation. Here we have optimized an approach for the Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids by Phosphate (SILAP) using [-18O4]ATP in nucleo to determine global site-specific phosphorylation rates. The advantages of this metabolic labeling technique are: increased confidence in phosphorylated peptide identification, direct labeling of phosphorylation sites, measurement phosphorylation rates, and the identification of actively phosphorylated sites in a cell-like environment. In this study we calculated approximate rate constants for over 500 phosphorylation sites based on labeling progress curves. We measured a wide range of phosphorylation rate constants from 0.34 min-1 to 0.001 min-1.  Finally, we applied SILAP to determine sites that have different phosphorylation kinetics during G1/S and M phase. We found that most sites have very similar phosphorylation rates under both conditions; however a small subset of sites on proteins involved in the mitotic spindle were more actively phosphorylated during M phase, while proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription were more actively phosphorylated during G1/S phase.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000680

Contractile work contributes to maturation of energy metabolism in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes	Energy metabolism is a key aspect of cardiomyocyte biology. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising tool for biomedical application, but they are immature and have not undergone metabolic shift related to early postnatal development. Cultivation of hiPSC-CM in 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) format leads to morphological maturation. This study compared the mitochondrial and metabolic state of hiPSC-CM in standard 2D culture and the EHT format and determined the influence of contractile activity. HiPSC-CM in EHTs showed ~2-fold higher number of mitochondria (electron microscopy), mitochondrial mass (mitotracker), DNA (Mt-ND1, Mt-ND2), and protein abundance (proteome) than in 2D culture. While hiPSC-CM exhibited the principal ability to use glucose, lactate and fatty acids as energy substrates irrespective of culture format, hiPSC-CM in 3D performed more oxidation of glucose, lactate and fatty acid, and less anaerobic glycolysis. The increase in mitochondrial mass and DNA in 3D was diminished by pharmacological inhibition of contractile force, suggesting that contractile work participates in mitochondrial development hiPSC-CM. In conclusion, contractile work in the EHT format contributes to metabolic maturation of hiPSC-CM.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008205

Stable-protein Pair Analysis as A Novel Strategy to Identify Proteomic Signatures: Application to Seminal Plasma From Infertile Patients.	Our aim was to define seminal plasma proteome signatures of infertile patients categorized according to their seminal parameters using TMT-LC-MS/MS. To that extent, quantitative proteomic data was analyzed following two complementary strategies: (i) the conventional approach based on standard statistical analyses of relative protein quantification values; and (ii) a novel strategy focused on establishing stable-protein pairs. By conventional analyses, the abundance of some seminal plasma proteins was found to be positively correlated with sperm concentration. However, this correlation was not found for all the peptides within a specific protein, bringing to light the high heterogeneity existing in the seminal plasma proteome due to both the proteolytic fragments and/or the post-translational modifications. This issue was overcome by conducting the novel stable-protein pairs analysis proposed herein. A total of 182 correlations comprising 24 different proteins were identified in the normozoospermic-control population, while this proportion was drastically reduced in infertile patients with altered seminal parameters (18 in patients with reduced sperm motility, 0 in patients with low sperm concentration and 3 in patients with no sperm in the ejaculate). These results suggest the existence of multiple etiologies causing the same alteration in seminal parameters. Additionally, the repetition of the stable-protein pair analysis in the control group by adding the data from a single patient at a time enabled to identify alterations in the stable-protein pairs profile of individual patients with altered seminal parameters. These results suggest potential underlying pathogenic mechanisms in individual infertile patients, and might open up a window to its application in the personalized diagnostic of male infertility.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010579
Targeting the Scaffold Protein Plectin by an Organometallic as a Strategy to Inhibit Tumour Invasiveness- whole cell lysate of HCT 116 epithelial cells, plestatins-3 normal pull down 4h	The inability of determining direct molecular targets of metal-based therapeutic agents beyond the platinum class is one of the major bottlenecks in their development. Here, we employ an integrated chemical proteomics and response profiling approach to identify and validate plestatins, based on an organometallic ruthenium(II) scaffold, as selective plectin-targeting agents. Plectin is a giant scaffold protein involved in controlling cytoarchitecture. Subcytotoxic concentrations of plestatins induce drastic morphological phenotypes on the microtubule (MT) network accompanied by a global down-regulation of translational activity. Plestatins possess anti-invasive properties in tumour spheroids and also display tumour-inhibiting effects in vivo after oral administration. The ability of plestatins to alter the MT network via plectin represents a unique mechanism to target MTs and shows promise as an anticancer strategy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005389
Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - nuclear proteins of untreated fibroblasts	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003414

The circadian E3 ligase complex SCFFBXL3+CRY targets TLK2	We recently demonstrated that the circadian clock component CRY2 is an essential cofactor in the SCFFBXL3-mediated ubiquitination of c-MYC. Because our demonstration that CRY2 recruits phosphorylated substrates to SCFFBXL3 was unexpected, we investigated the scope of this role by searching for additional substrates of FBXL3 that require CRY1 or CRY2 as cofactors. Here, we describe an affinity purification mass spectrometry (APMS) screen through which we identified more than one hundred potential substrates of SCFFBXL3+CRY1/2, including the cell cycle regulated Tousled-like kinase, TLK2. Both CRY1 and CRY2 recruit TLK2 to SCFFBXL3, and TLK2 kinase activity is required for this interaction. Overexpression or genetic deletion of CRY1 and/or CRY2 decreases or enhances TLK2 protein abundance, respectively. These findings reinforce the idea that CRYs function as co-factors for SCFFBXL3, provide a resource of potential substrates, and establish a molecular connection between the circadian and cell cycle oscillators via CRY-modulated turnover of TLK2.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009522
Chr18 Consortium MS-data for missing proteins mining	Despite direct or indirect efforts of proteomic community, the fraction of blind spots on the protein map is still significant. Almost 10% (?) of human master protein has no experimental validation up to now. Apparently, proteomics has reached the stage where all easy scores are achieved (?), and every next identification requires more intension and curiosity in expansion of unusual types of biomaterial and/or conditions.

Proteogenomic Landscape of Squamous Cell Lung Cancer 2: Tandem Mass Tag Datasets	We report an integrated analysis incorporating DNA copy number analyses, somatic exon mutations, mRNA expression via RNA-sequencing, and shotgun mass spectrometry analysis of protein abundance in 108 surgically resected squamous cell lung cancers (SCC) with accompanying clinical outcome, evaluation of tumor pathology, and other clinically relevant data.  We identified three major subtypes of SCC at the proteomic level, with two groups associated with inflammation/immune response or oxidation-reduction biology.  Inflamed tumors could be further sub-classified based on neutrophil infiltration or antigen presentation proteomes and reflected patterns of infiltrating immune cells.  No gene mutations, mRNA signatures, or proteomic subclasses were associated with outcomes; however, the presence of B-cell rich tertiary lymph node structures could be associated with better patient outcomes.  By integrating our proteogenomic data with publicly available RNA interference screen data, we identified TP63, PSAT1, and AKR1C3 as vulnerabilities in SCC, particularly in the redox proteomic group.  This cohort and its deep molecular data serves as an important resource to better understand biology and targets associated with SCC.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010429
Homologous recombination repair and cholesterol-mediated drug efflux induce dose-dependent chemoresistance in nutrient-deprived neuroblastoma cells	Neuroblastoma is a solid pediatric tumor with heterogeneous clinical behaviors. Chemotherapy is widely used to treat neuroblastoma. However, dose-dependent responses and chemoresistance mechanisms of neuroblastoma cells to anticancer drugs remain challenges in various conditions. Here, we investigated the dose-dependent effects of topotecan on human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-BE) under various nutrient supply conditions. Serum-starved human neuroblastoma cells showed reduced toxicity, and their survival rate increased upon treatment with a high concentration (1 μM) of topotecan. Quantitative profiling of global and phosphoproteome identified 12,959 proteins and 48,812 phosphosites, respectively, from SK-N-SH cells. Network analysis revealed that topotecan up-regulated DNA repair and cholesterol-mediated topotecan efflux, resulting in topotecan resistance. Results of DNA damage assay, cell cycle, and quantitative analyses of membrane cholesterol supported the validity of these resistance factors and their applicability to all neuroblastoma cells investigated in this study. Our results provide a model for high dose-dependent chemoresistance in neuroblastoma cells that could enable a patient-dependent chemotherapy screening strategy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD014648
Cervicovaginal dysbiosis is associated with significant changes in the cervicovaginal proteome related to immune activation and increased cell death	Cervicovaginal microbiome dysbiosis is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of sexually transmitted infections including HIV. We compared the cervicovaginal proteome as characterised by mass-spectrometry of four groups of African female sex workers (total N=50) grouped by microbiome composition as characterised by 16S rDNA microarray.  Group 1 had a Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated microbiome, group 2 a L. iners-dominated microbiome, and groups 3 and 4 had a microbiome containing multiple genera of anaerobic bacteria, with group 3 representing transition to or from dysbiosis and group 4 full dysbiosis. 82 human proteins were differentially abundant among the groups, either showing an increasing or decreasing trend from microbiome groups 1 to 4. Proteins that increased included proteasome subunits and other proteins involved in catabolic metabolism, actin organising proteins and proteins involved in the immune response. Proteins that decreased included antiproteases, keratins, and cornified envelope proteins. We also compared the abundance of pre-defined proteins of interest among microbiome groups: markers of cell type, inflammation, and cell death, and mucins. The dysbiotic groups had increased abundance of proteins unique to lymphocytes and macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell death markers, and MUC5B. We conclude that the cervicovaginal human proteome is associated with the cervicovaginal microbiome in a dose-response manner. The changes are likely caused by a pro-inflammatory influx of immune cells and an increase of cell death in dysbiosis. Dysbiosis-associated immune activation, breaches in epithelial integrity, altered mucin balance, and altered protease-antiprotease balance may all contribute to the increased risk of HIV transmission when cervicovaginal dysbiosis is present.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001435

Large-scale HDMSE mapping of the normal sputum proteome	Severe asthma is a collection of disease entities with varying pathophysiological characteristics that result in symptoms of cough, wheeze and breathlessness, with frequent exacerbations. To address the problem of phenotypic difference and heterogeneity, the Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) project was set up as a public-private partnership within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), engaging academia, the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups. The goal of this investigation was to identify proteomic fingerprints in induced sputum that characterize patients with severe asthma and to determine whether subgroups of severe asthmatics can be identified. Furthermore, we were interested in elucidating the biological pathways that showed differences between subgroups. This dataset is a description of the normal sputum proteome.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005949

Proteomic profiling of paired interstitial fluids revealed dysregulated pathways and salivary NID1 as a biomarker of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma	Patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are frequently first diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Early detection of OSCC using body fluid-accessible biomarkers may help improve the prognosis and survival rate of OSCC patients. As tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) is a proximal fluid enriched with cancer-related proteins, it is therefore a valuable reservoir suitable for the discovery of cancer biomarkers as well as dysregulated biological pathways in tumor microenvironment. Thus, we harvested and analyzed the paired tumor (TIF) and adjacent noncancerous (NIF) interstitial fluids from ten OSCC patients using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with the nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS) approach and label-free spectral counting method. The results showed that 113 proteins were up-regulated in at least six OSCC TIFs compared to their respective NIFs, and that the aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis was statistically enriched in TIFs by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The enrichment of aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis in OSCC was verified that four members (IARS, KARS, WARS, and YARS) were revealed to be elevated in OSCC by IHC (n = 12). Among the 113 up-regulated proteins, two candidates (NID1 and SERPINH1) were selected based on an integrated bioinformatics analysis and verified that the salivary NID1 levels were significantly higher in OSCC patients (n = 48) compared to health (n = 51) and OPMD individuals (n = 53). Moreover, the IHC results (n = 222) showed that the expression of NID1 was higher in OSCC compared to adjacent noncancerous epithelium and correlated with pathological T, N, and overall stage as well as survivals of OSCC patients. These results collectively indicate that the analysis of TIF is help to understand the tumor microenvironment, and that salivary NID1 is a potentially useful biomarker for the OSCC.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008654

Background Proteins in Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin Pharmaceutical Formulations of Different Origin	Gonadotrophins, including Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), have been used since and for several decades to treat infertility by ovarian stimulation. The hCG is being extracted from urine of pregnant women and it does inevitably contains other proteins secreted into urine. The presence of other proteins varies from batch to batch and it can be significantly high. Current study investigated the presence of proteins other than hCG in different batches of commercial formulations produced by extraction from urine and by using the recombinant approach. The total protein content varied from batch to batch and a large number of contaminant urinary proteins were identified in all analyzed samples except for the recombinant product	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010471

Quantitative proteomics in G1 cells reveals the insulin receptor adaptor IRS2 as an APC/CCdh1 substrate	The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle by targeting key substrates for degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. During G1, the APC/C works in concert with its co-activator Cdh1 to recognize and ubiquitinate specific substrates during this phase of the cell cycle. While many APC/CCdh1 substrates play a role cell cycle regulation, others are involved in distinct cellular processes, indicating that diverse biological pathways are subject to APC/C-mediated control. To identify novel pathways and substrates regulated by APC/CCdh1, we conducted an unbiased proteomic screen in G1-arrested RPE1 cells acutely treated with small molecule APC/C inhibitors. Combining these results with degron prediction analysis, we discovered a range of putative APC/C substrates. We validated IRS2, a key adaptor protein involved in signaling downstream of the insulin and IGF1 receptors, as a novel direct APC/CCdh1 target. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of IRS2 reduces the expression of proteins involved in cell division and functionally impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint. Together, these findings reveal a novel connection between the insulin/IGF1 signaling network and the cell cycle regulatory machinery.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD018329
Systematic and quantitative assessment of hydrogen peroxide reactivity with cysteines across human proteomes	Protein cysteinyl residues are the mediators of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent redox signaling. However, site-specific mapping of the selectivity and dynamics of these redox reactions in cells poses a major analytical challenge. Here we describe a chemoproteomic platform to systematically and quantitatively analyze the reactivity of thousands of cysteines toward H2O2 in human cells. We identified >900 H2O2-sensitive cysteines, which are defined as the H2O2-dependent redoxome. Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H2O2-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H2O2-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications. Notably, our chemoproteomic platform also provides an opportunity to predict oxidation-triggered protein conformational changes. The data are freely accessible as a resource at http://redox.ncpsb.org/OXID/.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007153

The development of candidate RM 8461 Human Liver for Proteomics was undertaken to provide the community with a sample with suitable complexity for method development and validation, instrument and data validation, and determining identification QC thresholds. Herein we describe a comparison of methods and homogeneity assessment in which candidate RM 8461 Human Liver for Proteomics is solubilized, the proteins reduced, alkylated, digested and the tryptic peptides and their modifications are identified by bottom up LC/MS/MS to assess deep (e.g. thousands of identifications) protein coverage.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013608
Comparison of targeted mass spectrometry techniques with an immunoassay: a case study for HSP90 alpha	We developed 2D-LC-MS/MS-based SRM and PRM assays to measure HSP90 alpha in serum and compared the results to a commercially available immunoassay (ELISA). Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM. This opens up the possibility to quantify low levels of multiple proteins in complex samples based on a fractionation strategy on tryptic peptides followed by PRM.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006615
Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - nuclear proteins of inflammatory stimulated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003409
Human Bile LC-MS/MS -  One Sample, One Shot - Evaluation of sample preparation protocols for the mass spectrometric proteome analysis of human bile fluid without extensive fractionation	The proteome analysis of bile fluid represents a promising strategy to identify biomarker candidates for various diseases of the hepatobiliary system. However, to obtain substantive results in biomarker discovery studies large patient cohorts necessarily need to be analyzed. Consequently, this would lead to an unmanageable number samples to be measured if sample preparation protocols with extensive fractionation methods are applied. Hence, the performance of simple workflows allowing for "one sample, one shot" experiments have been evaluated in this study. In detail, sixteen different protocols implying modifications at the stages of desalting, delipidation, deglycosylation and tryptic digestion have been tested. Each method has been individually evaluated regarding various performance criteria and comparative analyses have been conducted to uncover possible complementarities. Here, the best performance in terms of proteome coverage has been assessed for a combination of acetone precipitation with in-gel digestion. Finally, a mapping of all obtained protein identifications with putative biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) revealed several proteins easily detectable in bile fluid. These results can build the basis for future studies with large and well-defined patient cohorts in a more disease-related context, instead of a technical one as reported here.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004476

New insights into hypoxia-driven metabolic, anti-apoptotic and immune evasion strategies of primary human myeloma cells	Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy primarily localized within the bone marrow (BM). It develops from a premalignant stage, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), often via an intermediate stage, smoldering MM (SMM). The mechanisms of MM progression have not yet been fully understood, all the more because patients with MGUS and SMM already carry the same initial mutations found in MM cells. Over the last years, more and more importance has been attributed to the tumor microenvironment and its role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Adaptations of MM cells to the hypoxic conditions in the BM have been shown to contribute to a significant extent to MM progression, independently from the genetic predispositions of the tumor cells. To get deeper insights into such hypoxia-induced adaptations, we decided to investigate primary human MM cells. CD138-positive plasma cells freshly isolated from the BM of patients with different disease stages, comprising MGUS, SMM, and MM, were analyzed by proteome profiling using a Q Exactive orbitrap. Data previously obtained from peripheral B cells were included for comparative purposes. As a first, rather unexpected result, we were able to identify three clusters differentiating B cells as well as MM cells corresponding to less and more advanced disease stages. Comparing on the one hand B cells to MM cells, and on the other hand the two clusters of MM cells allowed us to determine transcription factors apparently involved in MM development and progression, as well as protein regulatory networks obviously related to metabolic adaptations and immune evasion strategies used by MM cells to overcome limitations imposed by hypoxia. Based on these results, new opportunities may arise for developing therapeutic strategies targeting the progression from less to more advanced stages of MM.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010600

Metabolic changes related to the IDH1 mutation in gliomas preserve TCA-cycle activity: an investigation at the protein level	The discovery of the IDH1 R132H (IDH1 mut) mutation in low-grade glioma and the associated change in function of the IDH1 enzyme has increased the interest in glioma metabolism. In an earlier study, we found that changes in expression of genes involved in the aerobic glycolysis and the TCA-cycle are associated with IDH1 mut. Here we apply proteomics to FFPE samples of diffuse gliomas with or without IDH1 mutations, in order to map changes in protein levels associated with this mutation. We observed significant changes in the enzyme abundance associated with aerobic glycolysis, glutamate metabolism and the TCA-cycle in IDH1 mut gliomas. Specifically, the enzymes involved in the metabolism of glutamate, lactate and enzymes involved in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate were increased in IDH1 mut gliomas. In addition, the bicarbonate transporter (SLC4A4) was increased in IDH1 mut gliomas, supporting the idea that a mechanism preventing intracellular acidification is active. We also found that enzymes that convert proline, valine, leucine and isoleucine into glutamate were increased in IDH1 mut glioma. We conclude that in IDH1 mut glioma metabolism is rewired (increased input of lactate and glutamate) to preserve TCA cycle activity in IDH1 mut gliomas.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016698

Human_Testis_QE-HF -  Deep Coverage Proteomics Identifies More Low-Abundance Missing Proteins in Human Testis Tissue with Q-Exactive HF Mass Spectrometer	The Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) aims at finding existence evidence of missing proteins (MPs) at the early stage. Based on previous research, it has been proved that human testis tissue is suitable for further research of MPs because of its high gene expression level and high transcriptome complexity. However, the limits of dynamic range in mass spectrometric analysis and the deficiency in sensitivity and resolution will seriously affect the detection efficiency.

Extracellular vesicles from human plasma and serum are carriers of extravesicular cargo - implications for biomarker discovery	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may serve as biomarkers for multiple purposes, samples of plasma and serum offer in the form of liquid biopsy a relatively non-invasive means to obtain EV-mediated molecular information. High throughput sampling and analytics for the search of EV-borne biomarkers is facilitated by the availability of biobanks, but the samples in biobanks have not been collected with EVs in mind. In addition to anticoagulation, pre-analytical steps of EV-research as e.g. agitation and prolonged incubation cause ex vivo platelet activation and vesiculation. This study analyses the effects of common anticoagulation (citrate, EDTA and ACD) and clotting on EV-samples from plasma/serum pools that had been equally treated during the blood collection and utilizing the currently approved preanalytical steps. Blood samples were obtained from healthy, fasting volunteers. Volunteers had not used any medication for the previous 7 days. Pools of samples were analyzed with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MSE. Statistical analyzes were performed to identify proteins distinguishing different sample types. With two or more unique proteins per identification, 163 proteins were quantified. A clear separation between sample types was seen in principal component analysis. 42 proteins showed statistically significant difference between sample types. The set of proteins was studied further with network, pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses, and found to participate in e.g. cell growth and maintenance.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015375

BMP1/Tolloid-like substrates by iTRAQ degradomics	In this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to reveal the release of proteolytic fragments from the cell surface or the ECM by BMP-1. Thirty-seven extracellular proteins were found in significantly higher or lower amounts in the conditioned medium of HT1080 cells overexpressing BMP-1 and thus, could be considered as candidate substrates. Strikingly, three of these new candidates (betaglycan, CD109 and neuropilin-1) were TGF-Beta co-receptors, also acting as antagonists when released from the cell surface, and were chosen for further substrate validation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000786
Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010708

Structurally related hydrazone-based metal complexes with different antitumor activities variably induce apoptotic cell death	Three new complexes bearing the tridentate hydrazone-based ligand 2-(2-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)pyridine (L) were synthesized and structurally characterized. Biological tests indicate that the Zn(II) complex [ZnCl2(L)] • 0.5 H2O is of low cytotoxicity against the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. In contrast, the Cu(II) and Mn(II) complexes [CuCl2(L)] and [MnCl2(L)(OH2)] • H2O are highly cytotoxic with EC50 values of 1.25  0.01 M and 20  1 M, respectively. A quantitative proteome analysis reveals that treatment of the cells with the Cu(II) complex leads to a significantly altered abundance of 102 apoptosis-related proteins, whereas 38 proteins were up- or down-regulated by the Mn(II) complex. A closer inspection of those proteins regulated only by the Cu(II) complex suggests that the superior cytotoxic activity of this complex is likely to be related to an initiation of caspase-independent cell death (CICD).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005507
Extending the Compatibility of the SP3 Paramagnetic Bead Processing Approach for Proteomics	The broad variability in protein and peptide biochemistry necessitates robust protocols and reagents for efficiently handling these molecules prior to analysis with mass spectrometry (MS) or other techniques. In this study, further exploration of the paramagnetic bead-based approach, Single-Pot Solid-Phase-Enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3), is carried out. The SP3 approach was tested in a wide range of experimental scenarios, including: 1. Binding solvents (acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone); 2. Binding pH (acidic vs. neutral/basic); 3. Solvent/lysate ratios (50% - 200%, v/v); 4. Mixing and rinsing conditions (on-rack vs. off-rack rinsing); 5. Enrichment of non-denatured proteins; 6. Enrichment of individual proteins from non-complex mixtures. These results highlight the robust handling of proteins in a broad set of scenarios, while also enabling development of a modified SP3 workflow that offers extended functionality. The modified SP3 approach is used in quantitative in-depth proteome analyses to compare it with commercial paramagnetic bead-based HILIC methods (MagReSyn) and across multiple binding conditions (e.g. pH and solvent during binding). Together, these data reveal the extensive quantitative coverage of the proteome possible with SP3 independent of the binding approach utilized. The results further establish the utility of SP3 for the unbiased handling of peptides and proteins for proteomic applications.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008698
Quantitative proteome analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive tumors and the treatment outcome of this disease is improved when the cancer is diagnosed at early stages. This requires biomarkers allowing for an accurate and early tumor diagnosis. To identify potential markers for such applications we performed a label-free proteome analysis using samples collected from 19 patients. We analyzed the data considering events known to take place in early events of HCC development such as abnormal regulation of Wnt/b-catenin and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We expected that such analysis can lead to the identification of potential biomarkers for early-stage HCC diagnosis. 31 proteins functionally linked to downstream interactors of Wnt/b-catenin and parts of RTKs´-activated pathways Ras and JAK/STAT were selected for verification in a larger and independent cohort (n= 31) using selected (multiple) reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002171
Signaling network diversification during differentiation sensitizes AML cells to PAK and MEK inhibitors	A main requirement for precision medicine is the identification of patients that are more likely to respond to a particular drug. AML is a heterogeneous disease in which molecules associated to kinase signaling are frequently mutated. However, no kinase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of this malignancy. Thus, patient stratification requires new molecular profiling techniques in addition of to the current sequencing strategies. We have used a multiomics approach that combines proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mass cytometry and DNA sequencing to classify primary AML cells derived from 36 patients. Comprehensive integrative analysis identified molecular signatures based on phosphopeptide abundance or surface marker expression that separate AML cases according to their differentiation status. Differentiated cells presented a particular pattern of protein phosphorylation, an enrichment in the activity of several kinases and a higher sensitivity to PAK, MEK and PKC/FLT3 inhibitors. In addition, mutations in proteins closely linked to kinase signaling were more frequent on differentiated cells. Interestingly the set of patients with differentiated cells as clustered by marker expression signatures showed an increased overall survival in our set of patients and in the TCGA database registered cohort. Thus, molecular differentiation signatures could be used as prognosis and drug response markers in order to implement the application of precision medicine in AML patients.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005978
Proteomic analysis of integrin-associated adhesion complexes isolated from cells treated with DMSO or FAK inhibitor	Human foreskin fibroblast cells were spread on fibronectin (FN) for 1 h and treated with DMSO or FAK inhibitor (3 uM, AZ13256675 (termed AZ675 for short)) for 1 h. Integrin-associated adhesion complexes isolated from these cells were analysed by mass spectrometry to determine changes in adhesion complex composition upon FAK inhibition. As a negative control, complexes were also isolated from cells attached to transferrin (Tf), which allows integrin-independent adhesion via the transferrin receptor.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002720

Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - tumor-distant tissue sections	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001325
Integrative MHC-I peptidome quantitation with isobaric tagging mass spectrometry	Despite the appreciation of CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immune responses towards improvement patient outcomes, the MHC-I peptides that facilitate the response are poorly described. Alternatively, whether cancer therapies alter the MHC-I peptide repertoire has not been fully assessed due to the lack of quantitative strategies. In this regard, anthracyclines and ionizing radiation both increase the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumors but whether they do so by altering the MHC-I peptidome repertoire is not known. To investigate this, we developed a platform for screening therapy-induced MHC-I peptides by quantitative, multiplexed measurement of MHC-I peptides with tandem mass tags (TMT). We show that both ionizing radiation and the anthracycline doxorubicin induce MHC-I peptides that are largely derived from mitotic progression and cell cycle proteins. Our approach enables further strategies to understand how small molecules and other therapies alter MHC-I peptide presentation that may be harnessed for CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011464
Identification of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Anchored Proteins and ω-sites Using TiO2-Based Affinity Purification	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the outer leaflet of the membrane microdomains, commonly referred to as lipid rafts, play important roles in many biological processes. To enable large-scale site-specific analysis of GPI anchoring, we developed a method for identification of ω-sites by mass spectrometry by combining titanium dioxide-based affinity purification and hydrogen fluoride treatment. This method was able to identify ~3-fold more GPI-APs than our previous method: the new technique identified a total of 73 ω-sites derived from 49 GPI-APs. In 13 of the 49 GPI-APs identified, the GPI-anchor attached to multiple amino acids in the C-terminal site, yielding a variety of different protein species. This method allows us to simultaneously identify many GPI-AP protein species with different ω-sites.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003105
Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - secreted proteins of dexamethasone-treated inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001423

Macro-porous Reversed Phase Separation of Proteins Combined with Reversed Phase Separation of Phosphopeptides and Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Profiling the Phosphoproteome of MDA-MB-231 cells	A new method of combining macro-porous reversed phase (mRP) protein fractionation with reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) peptide separation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is reported for profiling the phosphoproteome of a complex sample. In this method, an mRP-C18 column was used to fractionate the proteins from a whole cell lysate of a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, into 38 fractions. Each fraction was subjected to tryptic digestion, sequential phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), followed by capillary RPLC-MS/MS analysis. For comparison, the conventional method of using strong cation exchange (SCX)-RPLC separation of peptides combined with MS/MS was also used for analyzing the phosphoproteome. Replicate experiments by the mRP-RPLC method identified 1585 distinct phosphoproteins with 4519 phosphopeptides, compared to 1585 phosphoproteins with 4297 phosphopeptides by SCX-RPLC, with a total of 1947 phosphoproteins and 6278 phosphopeptides identified from the combined results. While the two methods have similar ability in the identification of the phosphoproteome, they produce complementary information. The phosphoproteins identified in this study, including 67 novel phosphorylation sites from 56 breast cancer related proteins, can serve as the entry point for future validation with biological implications in breast cancer.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000948
An immunoproteomic approach to characterize the CAR interactome and signalosome	Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells is expected to become the first line of treatment for multiple malignancies, following the enormous success of anti-CD19 therapies. However, their mechanism of action is not fully understood, and clear guidelines for the design of safe and efficient receptors are missing. We hereby describe a systematic analysis of the CAR “signalosome” in human primary T cells. Two CAR designs were compared: a second-generation (PSCA2) and a third-generation (PSCA3) anti-PSCA CAR. Phosphorylation events triggered by CAR-mediated recognition of target cells were quantified by mass spectrometry.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007086
Molecular basis of senescence transmitting in the population of human endometrial stromal cells	Hormone-regulated proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) determine overall endometrial plasticity and receptivity to embryos. Previously we revealed that ESCs may undergo premature senescence, accompanied by proliferation loss and various intracellular alterations. Here we focused on whether and how senescence may be transmitted within the ESCs population. We revealed that senescent ESCs may induce paracrine senescence in young counterparts via cell contacts, secreted factors and extracellular vesicles. According to secretome-wide profiling we identified plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) to be the most prominent protein secreted by senescent ESCs. By applying CRISPR/Cas9 techniques we disclosed that PAI-1 secreted by senescent ESCs may serve as the master-regulator of paracrine senescence progression within the ESCs population. Unraveled molecular basis of senescence transduction in the ESCs population may be further considered in terms of altered endometrial plasticity and sensitivity to invading embryo, thus contributing to the female infertility curing.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015742
Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - cytoplasmic proteins of CLL cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006578
Changes in the turnover of the cellular proteome during metabolic reprogramming: A role for mtROS in proteostasis	The role played by protein turnover in metabolic reprogramming is unknown. Herein, using a SILAC approach, we have studied the changes in the half-life of two hundred and sixty-six proteins of energy metabolism and of translation during the metabolic switch induced by the prolyl hydroxylases inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). DMOG induces HIF-1α expression and triggers the activation of glycolysis and the concurrent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in colon cancer cells. Changes in the activity of energy provision pathways correlated with increased turnover rates of glycolytic enzymes and the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, reprograming also stabilized the proteins of translation. The partial DMOG-mediated arrest of the synthesis of mitochondrial and translation proteins results from the inhibition of the mTORC1/p70SK/S6 signaling pathway. In contrast, DMOG stimulated the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes, emphasizing the opposite and differential regulation of the two pathways of energy provision. Addition of MitoQ, a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) scavenger, stabilized the turnover of cellular proteins similarly as when protein degradation is inhibited with leupeptin, a serine-protease inhibitor. Overall, the results show that the higher the activity of a pathway the lower is the half-life of the proteins involved and suggest a role for mtROS in cellular proteostasis.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013482

Blood plasma and serum samples of healthy donors fractionated on different chromatography sorbents	Blood as connective tissue potentially contain evidence of all processes occurring within the organism, at least in trace amounts. Because of their small size, peptides overcome cell membranes and epithelial barriers more freely than proteins. Among the peptides found in blood, there are both fragments of proteins secreted by various tissues and performing their function in plasma, as well as receptor ligands: hormones, cytokines, mediators of the cellular response. In addition, in minor amounts, there are disease peptide markers (for example, oncomarkers) and even foreign peptides related to pathogenic organisms and infection agents. To characterize the normal peptidome LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out of blood serum and plasma samples taken from 20 healthy donors on TripleTOF 5600+ mass-spectrometer. Sample preparation was carried out based on our previously developed method of peptide desorption from the surface of abundant blood plasma proteins followed by standard chromatographic steps.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008141
HAX1-interactome in breast cancer cell line (MCF7)	The MCF7 cell line represents a typical epithelial cell line and corresponds to luminal A breast cancer (estrogen-responsive). Overexpression of HAX1 was demonstrated in MCF7 cell line as well as in breast cancer samples, suggesting a role of HAX1 in breast cancer progression. HAX1 is a 32-kDa protein of unknown structure, involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cell migration and calcium homeostasis. It was also shown to bind mRNA. Scarcity of structural elements and the presence of a disordered region, inferred from HAX1 sequence, suggests that HAX1 is intrinsically disordered, and may have many protein-protein interactions. So far about 40 different proteins were characterized as HAX1 protein partners. In the present work, applying immunoaffinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified new candidates for HAX1 binding partners in breast cancer cells. Newly identified proteins may be divided into three, partially overlapping groups: cytoskeleton-associated proteins, GTP-ase associated proteins and RNA-binding proteins. These results imply that HAX1 has more protein partners than hitherto described. Subsequent analysis of these interactions may shed some light into molecular mechanisms of HAX1 functions.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007888

The human islet of Langerhans proteome database	Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide disease reaching epidemic dimensions. The rapid progression of the disease urgently calls for both a broader and deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In line with this statement, the Human Diabetes Proteome Project (HDPP) was officially launched at the 11th HUPO meeting in Boston, 2012. A special session was dedicated to this new initiative, gathering experts in the main topics related to diabetes and its associated complications. Key issues were debated with a focus on how deranged circulating glucose and free fatty acids induce dysfunction. It has been decided that HDPP will therefore focus on studying the early stages of diabetes that lead to abnormal glucose and lipid levels. The initiative will initially focused on islets of Langerhans, insulin-producing cell lines, and blood human samples from diabetes-related cohorts. In subsequent stages HDPP will investigate target tissues in which glucose and lipids could promote protein dysfunctions. Omics-rooted systems approaches enhanced by bioinformatics will be deployed to unravel effects of lipids and glucose triggering diabetes initiation and progression. A first milestone has been defined for the 12th HUPO meeting in Yokohama, 2013: the 1000 diabetes-associated protein (the 1000-HDPP) database, i.e. a freely available internet resource (www.HDPP.info) of more than 1000 proteins with links to their corresponding proteotypic peptides, affinity reagents and protein-specific biological/biomedical information.

Effect of Rosuvastatin on the Lipoprotein Proteome	Statins lower plasma cholesterol by as much as 50%, thus reducing future cardiovascular events. However, the physiological effects of statins are diverse and not all are related to LDL-C lowering. We performed a small clinical pilot study to assess the impact of statins on lipoprotein-associated proteins in healthy individuals (n=10) with normal LDL-C (<130 mg/dL), who were treated with rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 28 days. Proteomic analysis of size-exclusion chromatography isolated LDL, HDL-L (large) and HDL-S (small) fractions and spectral counting was used to compare relative protein detection before and after statin therapy. Significant protein changes were found in each lipoprotein pool and included both increases and decreases in several proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, complement regulation and acute phase response. The most dramatic effect of the rosuvastatin treatment was an increase in alpha-1-antirypsin (A1AT) spectral counts associated with HDL-L particles. Quantitative measurement by ELISA confirmed an average 5.7-fold increase in HDL-L associated A1AT. Molecular modeling predictions indicated that the hydrophobic reactive center loop of A1AT, the functional domain responsible for its protease inhibitor activity, is likely involved in its lipid binding and its association with HDL was found to protect A1AT against oxidative inactivation. Cell culture experiments, using J774 macrophages, demonstrated that the association of A1AT with HDL enhances its anti-protease activity, preventing elastase induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, we show that statins can significantly alter the protein composition of both LDL and HDL and our studies reveal a novel functional relationship between A1AT and HDL. The upregulation of A1AT on HDL enhances its anti-inflammatory functionality, which may contribute to the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects of statins.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002633

Assessment of sample preparation bias in mass spectrometry-based proteomics	For mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the selected sample preparation strategy is a key determinant for information that will be obtained. However, the corresponding selection is often not based on a fit-for-purpose evaluation. Here we report a comparison of in-gel (IGD), in-solution (ISD), on-filter (OFD), and on-pellet digestion (OPD) workflows on the basis of targeted (QconCAT-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for mitochondrial proteins) and discovery proteomics (data dependent acquisition, DDA) analyses using three different human head and neck tissues (i.e. nasal polyps, parotid gland, and palatine tonsils). Our study reveals differences between the sample preparation methods, for example with respect to protein and peptide losses, quantification variability, protocol-induced methionine oxidation and asparagine/glutamine deamidation as well as identification of cysteine containing peptides. Moreover, none of the methods performed best for all types of tissues, which seemingly argues against the existence of a universal sample preparation method for proteome analysis.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008493
Human hepatic stellate cell-derived extracellular vesicles LC-MSMS	Activation and migration of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) followed by matrix deposition are characteristics of liver fibrosis.

Global proteome analysis of ATF4 targets during ER stress.	Cancer cells exploit many of the cellular adaptive responses to support their survival needs.  One such critical pathway in eukaryotic cells is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is important in normal physiology as well as disease states, including cancer. Since UPR can serve as a lever between survival and death, regulated control of its activity is critical for tumor formation and growth although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that one of the main transcriptional effectors of UPR, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) growth and survival.  To identify ATF4 target genes that mediate the ISR outcome and to get insight into its mechanism of action in PCa, we performed global proteomic expression profiling in parallel with transcriptomic expression profiling. These data show that ATF4 regulates important metabolic pathways in PCa cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD012858
Protein composition of the extracellular matrix in idiopathic germ cell aplasia	The somatic microenvironment supports spermatogonial stem cell differentiation into sperm. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays multiple roles in the stem cell niche, including self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and survival of spermatogonial cells.  The pathophysiology of male infertility might be representative of a progressive degenerative process of the testicular tissue, including ECM, rather than a defective genetic background, thus outlining the existence of chronic etiological agents/pathways. In this context, we sought to identify potential causative factors responsible for a number of modifications of the testicular somatic microenvironment associated with idiopathic germ cell aplasia in human beings. Proteomic analysis of the decellularized ECM was performed to study testis parenchyma from 10 idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermic (iNOA) men, dichotomized according to positive sperm retrieval versus germ cell aplasia. Germ cell aplasia was characterized by an increased nuclear distribution of the retinoic acid receptor  in Sertoli cells which was associated with decreased expression of the ECM markers, Nidogen-2 and Heparan sulfate proteoglycan-2. Decreased levels of the interstitial matrisome associated Factor IX and its regulator VKORC1 were instead coupled with decreased signaling of vitamin K in Leydig cells. This study identified pathogenetic signature of the somatic testicular microenvironment and provide mechanistic insights into the molecular determinants of human idiopathic germ cell aplasia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011817
CHPP chr 1,8,20 proteome dataset using the HCC cell lines of Hep3B and MHCC97H, instrument is Q Exactive, part 2 of 3	The fresh cells as described above were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 8 M Urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3 and 5 mM IAA. The total cell lysates were centrifuged with 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 degrees Celsius to remove cell debris, and 1.5 mg proteins for each cell line were followed by sequential in-solution protein digestion by Lys-C and trypsin at 37 degrees Celsius, respectively. The tryptic peptides were cleaned by C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters UK Ltd, Manchester, UK). The mass spectrometer used in this dataset was Q-Exactive. The dataset was produced with two technical replicates and 24 fractions per repeat. The database searching procedure was achieved using Mascot v2.3.

Comparison of Targeted MS Methods in Activity-Based Protein Profiling 2: DIA	To examine the different mass spectrometry approaches to monitoring kinases after enrichment with desthiobiotinylating probes for activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), two experiments were performed with H1993 lung cancer cells.  First, cell lysates were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle, dasatinib, or erlotinib prior to addition of the ATP probe for ABPP to compare the differences in kinase labeling associated with examples of kinase inhibitors that vary in target selectivity.  Then, to examine changes in cellular signaling, H1993 cells were treated with vehicle controls, BEX-235 (PI3K inhibitor), or Crizotinib.  LC-MS/MS using data dependent acquisition, data-independent acquisition (pSMART), parallel reaction monitoring, and selected reaction monitoring (or multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry were used to detect and relatively quantify the desthiobiotinylated kinase peptides.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006096
Proteomic characterization of neuromelanin granules isolated from human substantia nigra by laser-microdissection	Neuromelanin is a complex polymer pigment found primarily in the dopaminergic neurons of human substantia nigra. Neuromelanin pigment is stored in granules including a protein matrix and lipid droplets. Neuromelanin granules are yet only partially characterised regarding their structure and function. To clarify the exact function of neuromelanin granules in humans, their enrichment and in-depth characterization from human substantia nigra is necessary. Previously published global proteome studies of neuromelanin granules in human substantia nigra required high tissue amounts. Due to the limited availability of human brain tissue we established a new method based on laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry for the isolation and analysis of neuromelanin granules. With this method it is possible for the first time to isolate a sufficient amount of neuromelanin granules for global proteomics analysis from ten 10 µm tissue sections. In total 1,000 proteins were identified associated with neuromelanin granules. More than 68% of those proteins were also identified in previously performed studies. Our results confirm and further extend previously described findings, supporting the connection of neuromelanin granules to iron homeostasis and lysosomes, respectively endosomes. Hence, this method is suitable for the donor specific enrichment and proteomic analysis of neuromelanin granules.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004987
Tandem affinity purification of monobodies against STAT3	The aim of the proteomics experiment was to determine the specificity of the generated monobodies for the target protein STAT3. This was done in an affinity-enrichment experiment using two endogenously expressed and tandem-affinity-tagged monobodies in two different cell lines (Jurkat and K562). Eluted proteins after affinity purification were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analysed using bottom-up proteomics workflow including tryptic digestion, LC-MS/MS, database-search and spectral counting.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD018374
Proteomics analysis of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded tissues in the investigation of prostate cancer	As proteins represent cell function, proteomic analysis of prostate tissues may elucidate the mechanisms of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. To that end, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are valuable resources, but associated with large analytical difficulties due to protein cross-linking. Our aim is to characterize tissue protein changes associated with castration resistant PCa. This study focused at the development of a reliable protocol for the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues which was followed by a pilot study using FFPE PCa clinical samples to investigate whether the optimized protocol can provide biologically relevant data in the context of PCa. Archival FFPE mouse tissues were processed using seven protein extraction protocols including combinations of homogenization means (beads, sonication, boiling) and buffers (Tris-HCl and Urea-Thiourea). The proteomics output was evaluated by SDS electrophoresis and high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. FFPE tissues (3 sections, 15������������������m each per sample) from 10 patients with PCa corresponding to tumor (GS=6 or GS���������������������������8) and adjacent benign regions were processed with the optimized protocol. Extracted proteins were analyzed by GeLC-MS/MS followed by statistical and bioinformatics analysis using Cytsoscape and Open Targets tool. A combination of cell lysis by Tris-HCl, SDS and DTE with bead homogenization, sonication and boiling provided most efficient protein extraction from FFPE tissues based on protein identifications and reproducibility. Comparison between the FFPE and matched FF tissues showed a substantial overlap in protein identifications (502 common out of 1,216 IDs commonly identified in all FF samples and 530 IDs commonly identified in all FFPE samples) with a strong correlation in relative abundances (rs=0.846, p<.001). Proteins significantly deregulated between PCa GS���������������������������8 and PCa GS=6 represented extracellular matrix organisation, phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis pathways, while proteins deregulated between cancerous tissues and benign counterparts, reflected increased translation, peptide synthesis and protein metabolism in the former, as expected. Further disease association analysis using the Open Targets platform showed that 60% of the differentially expressed proteins in cancer versus normal adjacent were significantly associated with PCa. These results support the relevance of the proteomic findings in the context of PCa and the reliability of the optimized protocol for proteomics analysis of FFPE material. A large scale study including 160 clinical FFPE prostate cancer and benign tissues to define protein changes associated with aggressive PCa, is planned.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015981

Eicosadomics, proteomics and metabolomics of inflammatory stimulated human fibroblasts reveals specific functions related to chronic inflammation - secreted proteins of dexamethasone-treated inflammatory stimulated cells	Fibroblasts have only recently been identified as important effector cells in inflammation. In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003971
4-Oxo-2-nonenal Adductions in Cells	4-Oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) derived from lipid peroxidation modifies nucleophiles and transduces redox signaling by its reactions with proteins. However, the molecular interactions between ONE and complex proteomes and their dynamics in situ remain largely unknown. Here we de-scribe a quantitative chemoproteomic analysis of protein adduction by ONE in cells, in which the cellular target profile of ONE is mimicked by its alkynyl surrogate. The analysis reveals four types of ONE-derived modifications in cells, including ketoamide and Schiff-base adducts to lysine, Michael adducts to cysteine, and a novel pyrrole adducts to cysteine. ONE-derived adducts co-localize and crosstalk with many histone marks and redox sensitive sites. All four types of modifications derived from ONE can be reversed site-specifically in cells. In summary, our study provides much-needed mechanistic insights into the cellular signaling and potential toxicities associated with this important lipid derived electrophile.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007149
Multi-omics approach to identify age-related changes in mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are bone-marrow derived cells, capable of multipotent differentiation into connective tissues including bone, tendon and cartilage. They are an attractive source for autologous cell-based treatments for a range of clinical diseases and injuries.  MSCs have been demonstrated to possess an age-related loss of cellular functions including differentiation potential and proliferation capacity; with implications for stem cell therapies in older patients. Furthermore the reduction in differentiation potential could contribute to ageing and age-related disease. Biological aging is coupled with a progressive reduction in the regulation of cellular, tissue and organ interaction, resulting in senescence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epigenetic, RNA and protein changes in ageing MSCs in order to understand the age-related functional and biological changes required for their applications in regenerative medicine.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001952
Exhaled breath condensate biomarkers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer using proteomics	The present study explored whether the proteomic analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may provide potential biomarkers for their use in non-invasive screening strategies for the early detection of lung cancer (LC). EBC was collected from 192 individuals (49 control volunteers, 49 risk factor-smoking volunteers, 46 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and 48 LC patients). Using LC-MS/MS a total of 348 different proteins with a different pattern among the four groups were identified in EBC samples. Despite the great variability observed among individuals, significantly more proteins were identified in the EBC from LC patients compared to other groups. Furthermore, the average number of proteins identified per sample was significantly higher in LC patients and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.8, indicating diagnostic value. Proteins frequently detected in EBC, such as dermcidin and hornerin, along with others much less frequently detected, such as hemoglobin and histone isoforms, were identified. Cytokeratins (KRTs) were the most abundant proteins in EBC samples and levels of KRT6A, KRT6B and KRT6C isoforms were significantly higher in samples from LC patients. Moreover, the amount of most KRTs in EBC samples from LC patients showed a significant positive correlation with tumor size. Finally, we used a random forest algorithm to generate a robust model using EBC protein data for the diagnosis of patients with LC. Thus, this study demonstrates that the proteomic analysis of EBC samples is an appropriated approach to develop biomarkers for the diagnosis of lung cancer.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006436

Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - nuclear proteins of untreated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003408

Response Profiling Using Shotgun Proteomics Enables Establishing Global Metallodrug Mechanisms of Action - cytoplasmic proteins of KP772-treated SW480 epithelial cells	Response profiling using shotgun proteomics for establishing global metallodrug mechanisms of action in two colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, was applied and evaluated with the clinically approved arsenic trioxide.  Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004796
High precision platelet releasate definition by quantitative reversed protein profiling	The platelet releasate defined by quantitative reversed protein profiling.  Dimethyl labeled proteins of platelets in resting (light label) and activated state (collagen and thrombin activation, intermediate label) from three healthy volunteers fractionated by SCX, analyzed on a LTQ Obitrap Velos using a data dependent decision tree method (HCD/ETD).Peak lists were generated from the raw data files using the Proteome Discoverer software package version 1.3.339. Peptide identification was performed by searching the individual peak lists (HCD, ETD-IT and ETD-FT) against a concatenated target-decoy database containing the human sequences in the Uniprot database (release 2012_06) supplemented with a common contaminants database using the Mascot search engine version 2.3 (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) via the Proteome Discoverer interface (version 1.3). The search parameters included the use of semitrypsin as proteolytic enzyme allowing up to a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification whereas oxidation of methionines and the dimethyl light and intermediate labels on N-termini and lysine residues were set as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was initially set at 50 ppm, while fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.6 Da for ETD-IT fragmentation and 0.05 Da for HCD and ETD-FT fragmentation. Subsequently, the peptide identifications were filtered for true mass accuracy <4 ppm and an ion score of 40 until an FDR <1% at peptide level was achieved.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000072

Antibody-free multiplex measurement of 23 human cytokines in primary cell culture secretome using targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry	Cytokines are commonly measured by immunoassays, which have limited multiplexing capacity, are costly and can exhibit cross-reactivity. Although multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry is a cost-effective method for multiplex measurement of peptides, the ability to detect the relatively low level of secreted cytokines in a complex biological matrix without extensive processing remains to be fully evaluated. We used human keratinocyte conditioned media as an experimental system to evaluate the assay linearity, reproducibility and limit of detection of a MRM assay targeting 23 human cytokines  with and without prior 2D chromatographic separation.  Without antibody enrichment or immunodepletion of high abundant proteins, the MRM assay could detect 21 cytokines by two or more unique peptides, and two cytokines by a single unique peptide. In a serum-free matrix, the limit of detection and quantification for the 79 monitored cytokine peptides ranged from 7 to 507pg/mL and 24 to 1689 pg/mL, respectively. The presence of serum reduced assay sensitivity however this could be compensated for by high-pH reversed-phase fractionation. Furthermore, the assay shows good replicate consistency with 8% intra- and 12% inter-day coefficient of variations, with increases in assay variability by circa 10% when a pre-fractionation step is included. In summary, our results show potential utility of a multiplex cytokine MRM for routine measurement of secreted cytokines in cellular experiments. Additional enrichment steps will be required in high complexity matrices such as serum.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015407

CD147 mutants affinity purification mass spectrometry from human T cells	CD147 is known as tumor and regulatory T cell marker and as regulator of chemotaxis, stress response or immune cell function; however, the mode of action of CD147 remains incompletely understood. Using affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of HA-tagged CD147 swap and deletion mutants, we examined the CD147 microenvironment. We found previously published interaction partners of CD147 and also identified two highly significant new ones: the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4) and moesin. The use of CD147 mutants allowed determining of the respective CD147 parts essential for interaction. Finally, we performed AP-MS of endogenous CD147 from primary human CD4+ T cells and again found CD147 associated with PMCA4.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003029
Curcumin exerts its potential antitumor effects in a context dependent fashion	Background Clinical practice demonstrates that anticancer drug effects may strongly vary between different patients. Individual responses to drug action are potentially responsible for adverse effects such as establishment of resistance. Consequently, the understanding of response mechanisms to drug actions is of great relevance. Proteome profiling is a powerful tool for the investigation of cellular responses to drugs.  Methods Here, we have investigated the effects of curcumin, a natural remedy with known anti-cancer activities, on breast cancer cells MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and normal mammary fibroblasts as well as co-cultures thereof using proteome profiling. The mammary fibroblasts had been treated before with TGF-beta in order to induce a wound-healing signature known to be representative for the in vivo situation in breast tumors.  Results While co-culture alone induced several proteins like ANXA1, S100A4 and SPARC similarly in both breast cancer cells, the majority of proteins regulated upon co-culture differed between MCF-7 and ZR-75-1. Curcumin significantly induced HMOX1 in all single cell models and co-cultures. However, otherwise the curcumin effects differed. In the MCF-7 co-culture, curcumin significantly downregulated RC3H1, a repressor of inflammatory signaling. In the ZR-75-1 co-culture, curcumin significantly downregulated PEG10, an anti-apoptotic protein, and induced RRAGA, a pro-apoptotic protein involved in TNF-alpha signaling. In this model, curcumin also induced AKR1C2, an important enzyme for progesterone metabolism. None of these specific curcumin effects were observed in single cell cultures.  Conclusions The present data demonstrate that curcumin induces proteome alterations potentially accounting for its known antitumor effects in a strongly context-dependent fashion.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008719

Proteoglycan sequencing -  Deep sequencing of complex proteoglycans: a novel strategy for high coverage and site-specific identification of glycosaminoglycan-linked peptides	Proteoglycans are distributed in all animal tissues and play critical, multifaceted, physiological roles.  Expressed in a spatially- and temporally-regulated manner, these molecules regulate interactions among growth factors and cell surface receptors and play key roles in basement membranes and other extracellular matrices.  Due to the high degree of glycosylation by glycosaminoglycan (GAG), N-glycan and mucin-type O-glycan classes, the peptide sequence coverage of complex proteoglycans is revealed poorly by standard mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods. As a result, there is little information concerning how proteoglycan site specific glycosylation changes during normal and pathological processes.  Here, we developed a workflow to improve sequence coverage and identification of glycosylated peptides in proteoglycans.

To determine the role of inflammation and the specific contribution of activated fibroblasts in cancer development and progression we analyzed six human CRC tissue specimens and paired normal adjacent mucosa samples by LS/MS-MS. Amongst other, indeed several inflammation associated proteins were found differentially expressed compared to normal colonic mucosa. Two candidate molecules, SPARC and THBS2 were recently identified as proteins of a fibroblast inflammation signature. Analysis of public available RNA expression datasets revealed, that the mRNA of both SPARC and THBS2 are upregulated in CRC, typically in association with the CRC consensus molecular subtype 4 [CMS4]. Immunohistochemistry staining also demonstrated upregulation of SPARC and THBS2 in the tumor stroma compared to normal adjacent mucosa and indicated co-localization with the mesenchymal marker [alpha]SMA. In vitro 3D co-culture experiments with human colon derived fibroblasts and CRC cell lines resulted in enhanced SPARC and THBS2 protein levels when both cell types were cultivated in direct physical contact, compared to fibroblasts or cancer cells alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting tumor-specific signatures by LC-MS/MS and compatibility with RNA expression datasets. We identified an inflammation signature in CRC tissue and the data emphasized the contribution of activated fibroblasts in these events.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006776
Oxygen-Sensitive Remodeling of Central Carbon Metabolism by Archaic eIF5B	The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) is a homolog of the ancient IF2, a translation factor that facilitates initiator methionine-tRNAiMet (met-tRNAiMet) delivery to ribosomes in prokaryotes. IF2 evolved during early anaerobic cellular life and can be traced back to the last universal common ancestor. Here, we show that eIF5B is essential for eukaryotic hypoxia tolerance, reminiscent of how IF2 supports prokaryotic anaerobiosis. Global protein synthesis analyses identified eIF5B as a hypoxia-specific translation factor involved in translocating met-tRNAiMet to initiating ribosomes. Systemic translatome studies revealed that eIF5B-dependent mRNAs encode proteins of central carbon metabolism, fructolysis, and other pathways enhanced in organisms inhabiting hypoxic niches. These pathways rely preferentially on eIF5B rather than eIF2, the canonical initiation factor that delivers met-tRNAiMet during aerobic eukaryotic protein synthesis. We suggest that eIF5B/IF2 was retained during evolution of the aerobic eukaryotic lineage to cope with episodes of oxygen deprivation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006799
Human testicular matrix -  Derivation and characterization of a cytocompatible scaffold from human testis	ITo derive a scaffold from human testis for the purpose of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, we developed a method to produce a cytocompatible decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) while maintaining the native tissue-specific characteristics and components. The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes. We have therefore developed a protocol for the preparation of cell-free extracellular matrix and characterized the material extensively using a combination of proteomics, immunohistochemsitry, and cell population assays. To prepare cell-free matrix, human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 h or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. The protein composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS. The retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure. Proteomics analysis revelaed the presence of  the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM were detected, indicating its complex nature. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTM scaffolds are not cytotoxic, as evidenced by MTT assay showing a normal fibroblast proliferation activity after indirect exposure, and support testicular cell attachment and infiltration.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001524
Proteomic analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue versus matched normal kidney tissue	We analyzed 84 tumor/normal pairs (177 total) using standard shotgun proteomic techniques in order to characterize the molecular landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and interrogated changes in protein abundance and biological pathways with ccRCC grade. These tissues were distributed across stage 1 (n = 34), 2 (n = 40), 3 (n = 42), and 4 (n = 52), with 9 pairs also including samples from metastasized tumor.  These data can be (and were) combined with a previously published transcriptomic data set from the same sample cohort (NCBI GEO: GSE53757).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003271

Liver metastatic growth in colorectal cancer depends on PAD4 leading to modification of the extracellular matrix by citrullination	Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently occurring malignancies and a major cause of cancer death. Distant metastases in this disease most commonly develop in the liver and are often untreatable.  Here, we show that citrullination of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cell derived peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is essential for the growth of liver metastases.  Citrullination of proteins, a post-translational conversion of arginine residues to citrulline, is well recognized in rheumatoid arthritis, but largely undocumented in cancer. PAD4, a key enzyme responsible for catalyzing citrullination, is produced by metastatic colorectal cancer cells and found at higher levels in human liver metastases than in normal liver. Functional significance for citrullination in metastatic growth was evident in murine models where inhibition of citrullination, either globally by pharmacologic inhibition of PADs or specifically in colorectal cancer cells by PAD4 knockdown substantially reduced liver metastatic burden. Additionally, citrullination of a key ECM component collagen type I led to greater adhesion and decreased migration of colorectal cancer cells along with increased expression of characteristic epithelial markers, suggesting a role for citrullination in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and liver metastasis. Overall, our study revealed the potential for PAD4-dependant citrullination to drive the progression of liver metastasis. These data indicate that inhibition of citrullination could be exploited to prevent the development of liver metastases in colorectal cancer.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010252
SILAC analysis of PDGF-treated primary bladder smooth muscle cells	SILAC analysis of human primary bladder smooth muscle cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor for 0, 4, and 24 h. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a mitogen and motogen that has been implicated in the proliferation, migration and synthetic activities of smooth muscle cells (SMC) that characterize pathologic tissue remodeling in hollow organs.  To explore the signals induced by PDGF on a global scale, we performed expression profiling and quantitative proteomics analysis of PDGF-treated human visceral SMC. 1695 genes and 241 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in PDGF-treated primary bladder SMC versus non-treated cells. Analysis of gene expression data revealed MYC, JUN, EGR1, MYB and RUNX1 as the transcription factors most significantly networked with upregulated genes; DDIT3, NFAT5, and SOX5 were most networked with downregulated genes.        For protein identification and quantification, raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed with MaxQuant software (version 1.0.13.13). The parameters were set as follows. In the Quant module, SILAC triplets was selected; oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-term) were set as variable modification; carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modification; concatenated IPI human database (version 3.52) (74,190 forward sequences and 74,190 reverse sequences) was used for database searching; all other parameters were default. Tandem mass spectra were searched by Mascot (version 2.2.0.4) (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). In the Identify module, all parameters were default, except that maximal peptide posterior error probability was set as 0.05. False discovery rates for protein and peptide identifications were both set at 0.01.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000624
Proteomic Explorations of Autism Brain - Part 1	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of common neurodevelopmental conditions with impairments in socialization, communication and restricted behaviors. Only a minority of ASD cases are determined to have a definitive etiology and the pathogenesis of most ASD remains poorly understood. In this study, we made use of the power of proteomics, heretofore little utilized in the study of the biology of ASD, and analyzed the proteomes of two brain regions, Brodmann area 19 (BA19) and posterior inferior cerebellum (CB), from 9 idiopathic ASD cases/9 matched controls by label-free HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and validated the differentially expressed protein findings with selected-reaction monitoring MS. The data revealed marked differences between ASD and control brain proteomes for both brain regions, with numerous differentially expressed proteins, although the proteomic difference between brain regions was not attenuated in ASD brain. Bioinformatic analyses based on the differentially expressed proteins highlighted multiple canonical pathways and protein-protein interaction networks that are implicated in the differential biology of ASD vs. controls. Canonical pathways involving glutamate receptor signaling and RXR activation were enriched for both BA19 and CB; others such as cell-cell junction signaling and fatty acid oxidation were enriched for BA19 and CB, respectively. Network analysis revealed a protein interaction network related to synaptic biology in BA19 and another involving cytoskeletal/vesicular functions in CB. Upstream regulator analysis for both regions revealed multiple neurodegeneration-associated proteins. The finding of several shared canonical pathways and upstream regulators for both regions underscores likely common ASD pathophysiology that has distinctive regional expression.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD012755

Aberrant membrane lipid composition and biophysical properties contribute to impair calcium exchanges in elliptocytosis - A severe case study	Hereditary elliptocytosis is a red blood cell (RBC) disease mainly caused by mutations in spectrin, leading to cytoskeletal destabilization. Although patients with heterozygous mutation in α-spectrin (SPTA1) are asymptomatic, morphological changes and hemolysis are observed upon reduced functional α-spectrin production. The molecular mechanism is unknown. We analyzed the consequences of a α-spectrin mutation in a patient almost exclusively expressing the Pro260 variant of SPTA1 (pEl). pEl RBCs showed decreased size and circularity and increased fragility. The pEl RBC proteome was globally preserved but spectrin density at the cell edges rised and the two membrane anchorage complexes were less segregated. Hence, the pEl membrane was strongly impaired. First, the lipidome was modified, showing decreased phosphatidylserine vs increased lysophosphatidylserine species. Second, although membrane transversal asymmetry was preserved, curvature at the RBC edges and rigidity were increased. Third, sphingomyelin-enriched domains were altered in abundance, membrane:cytoskeleton anchorage and cholesterol content were targeted by the plasmatic acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase). Fourth, membrane calcium exchanges through the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 and the efflux pump PMCA were impaired, leading to increased intracellular calcium and ROS, lipid peroxidation and methemoglobin. Mecanistically, increased curvature through lysophosphatidylserine membrane insertion in healthy RBCs abrogated calcium influx. Cholesterol depletion of sphingomyelin-enriched domains by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin in pEl RBCs worsened calcium accumulation whereas aSMase inhibition by amitriptyline did the opposite. Those data indicated that α-spectrin tetramerization defect, lysophosphatidylserine, cholesterol domain depletion and aSMase cooperate to alter membrane properties and calcium exchanges, leading to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress. It could help develop novel therapies	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD019059
Changes in the human platelet protein ubiquitylation landscape following GPVI activation	Platelet activators stimulate post-translational modification of signalling proteins to change their activity or their molecular interactions leading to signal propagation. One covalent modification is attachment of the small protein ubiquitin to lysine residues in target proteins. Modification by ubiquitin can either target proteins for degradation by the proteasome or act as a scaffold for other proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of deubiquitylases or the proteasome inhibits platelet activation by collagen, demonstrating a role for ubiquitylation, but relatively few substrates for ubiquitin have been identified and the molecular basis of inhibition is not established.  Here we report the ubiquitome of human platelets and changes in ubiquitylated proteins following stimulation by collagen related peptide (CRP-XL). We identified 1634 ubiquitylated peptides derived from 691 proteins, revealing extensive ubiquitylation in resting platelets. 925 of these peptides show an increase of more than 2-fold following stimulation with CRP-XL. Multiple sites of ubiquitylation were identified on a number of proteins including Syk, filamin and integrins. Adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen mediated by the major platelet integrin IIb3 is blocked by inhibition of deubiquitylases. This work reveals extensive protein ubiquitylation during activation of human platelets and opens the possibility of novel therapeutic interventions targeting the ubiquitin machinery.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009072

The pathogenesis of Guillain-Barre syndrome: peptidomic profiling of physiological fluids	Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) - one of the forms of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) - is a rare and severe disorder of the peripheral nervous system that also has an unknown etiology. One of the hallmarks of AIDP pathogenesis is a significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level in comparison with the peptidome/proteome profile of a representative number of CSF samples obtained from AIDP and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and control patients. In total, 2355 peptide fragments related to 795 proteins were found in CSF samples from AIDP patients, 1066 peptide fragments of 253 proteins in samples from MS patients, and 774 peptide fragments of 220 proteins from control patients. Proteomic studies detected 1103 proteins in the control cohort and 1402 proteins in the AIDP cohort. Our dataset suggests that the proteome of the CSF from AIDP and control patients overlaps by as much as 67%, whereas the peptidome is only 21.5% identical. Comparison of the peptidomic and proteomic data revealed that 80% of the peptides in the CSF of AIDP patients correspond to proteins that are not present in proteomic dataset. Importantly, a considerable number of differentially represented peptides are related to the proteins involved in the arrangement of the axonal domains. The observed peptidomic dataset indicates that specific proteins, which participate in the arrangement of the myelin sheath in the nodes of Ranvier, are degraded in the course of AIDP.  Here, we show that the proteins that are overrepresented in the CSF of AIDP patients are partially linked with defensive responses to bacteria and viruses. These observations are in line with the upregulation of CSF cytokines associated with innate immunity, which in turn surprisingly suggests that the destruction of axons is not accompanied by any indications of a distinct adaptive autoimmune process. We believe that the presented proteomic and peptidomic dataset of the CSF from AIDP patients will provide useful information regarding the mechanisms of AIDP pathogenesis in comparison with MS, which is the prolonged but incurable autoimmune degradation of the central nervous system.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002884
LC-MSMS analysis of human urine to identify early diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer	In order to detect proteins sensitive and specific enough to detect early stages of PCa, we performed a complex comparative proteomic study analyzing urine as a source for non-invasive biomarkers. We compared urine samples from patients with early PCa stages and Gleason score between 6 and 7 with samples from patients with BPH and other urological cancers, namely bladder and renal. The main goal of this study was to discover a diagnostic biomarker or set of biomarkers in urine, sufficiently sensitive to detect PCa in its early stages and specific enough to separate the disease from BPH or other urological cancers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008407

NAD Salvage Supports Serine Biosynthesis	Maintenance of NAD+ levels by mitochondrial complex I, the NAD+ salvage pathway, and other routes is an important factor in of neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Both the production of NAD+ and the metabolic enzymes that require it as a redox cofactor or substrate differ widely in abundance across cell types and conditions. Disruption in the NAD+ supply thus exerts different effects depending on the cellular NAD+ requirements existing in the cell. Pharmacological depletion of NAD+ is actively being pursued in cancer and other diseases but these effects are not fully understood. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics and metabolomics to understand the consequences of disrupting cellular NAD+ levels and find that inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway depletes serine biosynthesis from glucose by impeding the NAD+-dependent protein 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, breast cancers that depend on PHGDH are exquisitely sensitive to blocking the NAD+ salvage pathway. PHGDH, and the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage are also correlated in public tumor proteome and transcript datasets. These findings are immediately translatable to the pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT in PHGDH-dependent cancers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007790
Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Identifies Molecular Signature of Atherosclerotic Plaques from Symptomatic Patients	Recent findings have challenged the prevailing histology- or imaging-based definition of the “vulnerable plaque”. To investigate molecular characteristics associated with “clinical instability” of atherosclerosis, we performed a proteomics comparison of the vascular extracellular matrix and associated molecules in human carotid endarterectomy specimens from symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. The proteomics data were integrated with gene expression profiling and an analysis of protein secretion by lipid-loaded human vascular smooth muscle cells. The molecular signature of plaques from symptomatic patients identified by proteomics and at least one of the other two approaches comprised matrix metalloproteinase-9, chitinase-3-like protein 1, S100A8/S100A9, cathepsin B, fibronectin and galectin-3-binding protein. These biomarker candidates were measured in 685 subjects of the Bruneck Study and found to significantly predict the progression to advanced atherosclerosis (as assessed by repeated carotid ultrasound) and the incidence of cardiovascular disease over a 10-year follow-up period, highlighting the strength of tissue-based proteomics for biomarker discovery.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005130

Endothelial cells constitute an important metabolic organ in the physiological homeostasis of blood vessels and play a pivotal role in orchestrating the inflammatory response triggered by sepsis or endotoxemia.

Mevalonate pathway activity is a key determinant of radiation sensitivity in head and neck cancer	Radioresistance is a major hurdle in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we report a novel role for statin-based treatment of HNSCCs as an actionable and safe adjuvant to radiotherapy. Proteomic profiling and comparison of radiosensitive and radioresistant HNSCCs revealed differential regulation of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by pitavastatin (and other related statins) sensitized SQ20B cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and reduced their clonogenic potential. In an effort to uncover the mechanism behind this statin-mediated sensitization, we analyzed prenylation of several important cellular targets upon combined IR-statin treatment. Overall, this study reinforces the view that the mevalonate pathway is a promsing novel therapeutic target in radioresistant HSNCCs.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007188

Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001327

Proteomic analysis of sweat samples from tuberculosis patients	We performed a global proteomic profile of eccrine sweat sampled from patients with active pulmonary TB, other lung diseases (non-TB disease), and healthy controls.

We conclude tthat global proteomic profiling of eccrine sweat collected from TB and non-TB patients is a viable approach for the identification of unique proteins differentially present based on clinical cohort. These proteins may represent unique biomarker profiles that upon further verification and validation could be used to develop a non-sputum based test for diagnosis of active TB.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003224
Alteration of the plasma peptidome of gastrectomised patients during an OGTT	Performing gastric bypass surgery on patients severely changes their gut hormone response to glucose.

Human melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles reprogram dendritic cells potentially enabling lymph node metastases	Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile that precedes evidence of metastasis in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Herein, we explore the role of melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as mediators of this pre-metastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of dendritic cells (DCs). Utilizing mass cytometry, pre-metastatic SLNs demonstrate compromised co-stimulatory CD80 expression compared to healthy lymph nodes. Similarly, DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs showed impaired co-stimulation and polarization towards a chronic inflammatory cytokine milieu.  Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including the signaling axis S100A8, S100A9 and cognate receptor TLR4. Mechanistically, S100A8 and S100A9 compromised DC maturation, a phenotype which was partially recovered following TLR4 blockade. Early evidence demonstrates similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo.  Taken together, we propose synergistic interactions among melanoma EV cargo are responsible for suppressing DC maturation, potentially explaining the survival of malignant melanocytes metastasizing into seemingly “normal” regional lymph nodes.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005539

Discovery and quantification of non-human proteins in human milk	The question whether and which non-human peptides or proteins are present in human milk was raised many decades ago. However, due to cross-reactivity or nonspecific antibody recognition, the accuracy of detection by immunochemical methods has been a concern. Additionally, the relative low-abundance of non-human peptides/proteins in the complex milk sample makes them a challenging target to detect. Here, by deep proteome profiling we detected several non-human peptides, which could be grouped as non-human proteins. We next estimated their concentration in human milk by combining data-dependent shotgun proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring. First, we fractionated human milk at the protein level by using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by reduction, alkylation and in-gel digestion. The resulted peptide mixtures were subjected to proteomics analysis. We were able to detect 1577 human proteins in human milk. Additionally, we identified 109 non-human peptides, of which 71 were grouped in to 36 non-human proteins. In the next step, we targeted 37 non-human peptides and 9 of them could be repeatedly quantified in human milk samples. Peptides/proteins originating from bovine milk products were the dominant non-human proteins observed, notably bovine caseins (α-S1-, α-S2-, β-, κ-caseins) and β-lactoglobulin.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011599

Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - primary mammary fibroblasts treated with TGF-beta	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001323

Identification of novel SHARPIN binders	Sharpin, a multifunctional adaptor protein with oncogenic properties, regulates several signalling pathways. For example, Sharpin enhances signal-induced NF-κB signalling as part of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) and inhibits integrins, the T cell receptor, caspase1 and PTEN. However, despite recent insights into Sharpin and LUBAC function, a systematic approach to identify signalling pathways regulated by Sharpin has not been reported. Here, we present the first ‘Sharpin interactome’, which identifies a large amount of novel potential Sharpin interactors. These data suggest that Sharpin and LUBAC might regulate a larger number of biological processes than previously identified, such as endosomal trafficking, RNA processing, metabolism and cytoskeleton regulation. Importantly, using the Sharpin interactome we have identified a novel role for Sharpin in lamellipodium formation. We demonstrate that Sharpin interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a protein complex that catalyses actin filament branching, and that Sharpin and Arp2/3 colocalize in lamellipodia. We identified the Arp2/3-binding site in Sharpin and demonstrate using a specific Arp2/3-binding deficient mutant that the Sharpin-Arp2/3 interaction promotes lamellipodia formation in a LUBAC-independent fashion.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004734
Proteome of HDL from non-diabetic hemodialysis patients	Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and the altered biological properties of HDL particles have been pointed out in this burden. We aimed to describe the proteome of HDL from non-diabetic hemodialysis patients and proteins which were up and down represented in HDL particles of HD patients compared to heathy controls. HDL were sampled from the plasma of 9 non-diabetic HD and 9 potential kidney-donors patients with a sequential potassium bromide stepwise density gradient ultracentrifugation. Samples were analyzed using an nano-RSLC coupled on line with a Q-Orbitrap.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013301
Combined assessment of global proteome, phosphoproteome and N-terminal protein cleavage to characterize altered platelet functions in human Scott syndrome	The Scott syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder associated with a mutation in the gene encoding anoctamin-6 (TMEM16F). After stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, syndromatic platelets show a reduced phosphatidylserine exposure and do not form membrane blebs. Given the central role of anoctamin-6 in the platelet procoagulant response, we used quantitative proteomics to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and the complex phenotypic changes in Scott platelets compared to control platelets. Therefore, we applied an iTRAQ-based multi-pronged strategy to quantify changes in (i) the global proteome, (ii) the phosphoproteome and (iii) proteolytic events between resting and stimulated Scott and control platelets.  Our data indicate a limited number of proteins with decreased (70) or increased (64) expression in Scott platelets, among those we observed the absence of anoctamin-6 and the strong up-regulation of aquaporin-1. Furthermore, the quantification of 1,566 phosphopeptides revealed major differences between Scott and control platelets after stimulation with thrombin/convulxin or ionomycin. Finally, we quantified 1,596 N-terminal peptides in activated Scott and control platelets, 180 of which we identified as calpain-regulated, whereas a distinct set of 23 neo-N-termini was caspase-regulated. In Scott platelets, calpain-induced cleavage of cytoskeleton-linked and signaling proteins was down-regulated, in accordance with an increased phosphorylation state. Thus, multi-pronged proteomic profiling of Scott platelets provides detailed insight into their protection against detrimental Ca2+-dependent changes that are normally associated with phosphatidylserine exposure.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002883
A quantitative label-free analysis of the extracellular proteome of human supraspinatus reveals damage to the pericellular and elastic fibre niches in torn and aged tendons	Tears of the human supraspinatus tendon are common and often cause painful and debilitating loss of function. Progressive failure of the tendon leading to structural abnormality and tearing is accompanied by numerous cellular and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) changes in the tendon tissue. This proteomics study aimed to compare torn and aged rotator cuff tissue to young and healthy tissue, and provide the first ECM inventory of human supraspinatus tendon generated using label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS. Employing two digestion protocols (trypsin and elastase), we analysed grain-sized tendon supraspinatus biopsies from older patients with torn tendons and from young controls. Our findings confirm measurable degradation of collagen fibrils and associated proteins in old and torn tendons, suggesting a significant loss of tissue organisation. A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, raising the possibility that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006466
Multi omics evaluation of cutaneous melanoma cells and their cerebral metastasis from patient derived mouse xenografts suggest individually distinct adaptation strategies	Brain metastases of melanoma are associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis. It is not fully understood whether and how the selection of cells capable of metastasizing into the brain is accompanied by the establishment of specific features. For the investigation of these questions, we made use of previously described xenograft mouse models for primary human melanoma cells distinguishing cutaneous from cerebellar metastases from the same genetic background. Previous experiments suggested that cultured cells derived from these xenografts still maintain properties characteristic for the microenvironment of the originating metastases. Such corresponding pairs of metastatic cells were obtained from four individual donors, resulting in eight cell-lines presently investigated with regard to molecular properties characteristic for metastasis. Label free proteome profiling revealed significant alterations when comparing corresponding pairs of cutaneous and cerebellar metastases from the same donor. Molecules previously associated with metastasis such as cell adhesion molecules, immune regulators, epithelial mesenchymal transition markers, stem cell markers, redox regulators and cytokines were found differently expressed. This was also observed with regard to eicosanoids considered relevant for metastasis such as PGE2 and 12-HETE. However, no commonalities in the molecular characteristics of cerebellar metastases were identified in all four donors. Multiparametric morphological analysis of cells also revealed alterations associated with the kind of metastases, while lacking uniformity. In conclusion, here we describe that xenografted melanoma cells derived from two different microenvironments, i.e. cutaneous and cerebellar metastases, display significant alterations in the expression of molecules associated with metastastic properties. The observed lack of uniformity suggests that metastatic cells may find individual strategies to adapt to their microenvironmental challenges accompanied by the establishment of individual cell characteristics.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013765
Evaluation of iTRAQ and SWATH-MS for the quantification of proteins associated with insulin resistance in human duodenal biopsy samples	Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with increased production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins of intestinal origin. In order to assess whether insulin resistance affects the proteins involved in lipid metabolism, we used two mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics techniques to compare the intestinal proteome of 14 IR patients to that of 16 insulin sensitive (IS) control patients matched for age and waist circumference. A total of 3896 proteins were identified by the iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) mass spectrometry approach and 2311 by the SWATH-MS strategy (Serial Window Acquisition of Theoretical Spectra). Using these two methods, 208 common proteins were identified with a confidence corresponding to FDR < 1%, and quantified with p-value < 0.05. The quantification of those 208 proteins has a Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.728 across the two techniques. Gene Ontology analyses of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that annotations related to lipid metabolic process and oxidation reduction process are overly represented in the set of under-expressed proteins in IR subjects. Furthermore, both methods quantified proteins of relevance to IR. These data also showed that SWATH-MS is a promising and compelling alternative to iTRAQ for protein quantitation of complex mixtures.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001506
A Metaproteomics Approach to Elucidate Host and Pathogen Protein Expression during Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections	Long term-catheterization leads inevitably to a catheter-associated bacteriuria caused by multispecies bacterial biofilms growing on and in the catheters. The overall goal of the presented study was (I) to unravel bacterial community structure and function of such an uropathogenic biofilm and (II) to elucidate the interplay between bacterial virulence and the human immune system within the urine. To this end, a metaproteomics approach combined with in vitro proteomics analyses was employed to investigate both, the pro- and eukaryotic protein inventory. Our proteome analyses demonstrated that the biofilm of the investigated catheter is dominated by three bacterial species, i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii and Bacteroides sp., and identified iron limitation as one of the major challenges in the bladder environment. In vitro proteome analysis of P. aeruginosa and M. morganii isolated from the biofilm revealed that those opportunistic pathogens are able to overcome iron restriction via the production of siderophores and high expression of corresponding receptors. Notably, a comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein profiles of P. aeruginosa and M. morganii also indicated that the bacteria employ different strategies to adapt to the urinary tract. Whilst P. aeruginosa seems to express secreted and surface-exposed proteases to escape the human innate immune system and metabolizes amino acids, M. morganii is able to take up sugars and to degrade urea. Most interestingly, a comparison of urine protein profiles of three long-term catheterized patients and three healthy control persons demonstrated the elevated level of proteins associated to neutrophils, macrophages and complement system in the patient urine, which might point to a specific activation of the innate immune system in response to biofilm-associated urinary tract infections. We thus hypothesize that the often asymptomatic nature of CAUTI´s might be based on a fine-tuned balance between the expression of bacterial virulence factors and the human immune system.

Validation of alternatively spliced protein isoforms in human mesenchymal stem cells	Alternative splicing of mRNA diversifies the function of human proteins, with tissue- and cell-specific protein isoforms being the most difficult to validate. While transcriptomic experiments enable the detection of many alternatively spliced transcripts, it is not known if these transcripts have protein-coding potential. We recently published the PG Nexus pipeline, which facilitates high confidence validation of exons and exon-exon junctions of spliced transcripts by integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data. Using the PG Nexus, we analyzed undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells and compared the number of protein isoforms validated using different protein sequence database, including public online databases and RNA-seq derived databases. With significant overlaps with other databases, we identified 8,011 exons and 3,824 splice junctions with the Ensembl database. Both exonic and junction peptides were important for protein isoform validation. The Ensembl database consistently outperformed the other data sources, but predicted open reading frames from RNA-seq derived transcripts were comparable, with only 6 less splice junctions validated. Using proteotypic and isoform-specific peptides, we validated 462 protein isoforms. This number increases to 1,083 if multiple proteotypic peptides per protein are included. Multiplexing proteotypic peptides in SRM assays or similar experiments will increase the confidence and coverage of protein isoform validation experiments.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001449

Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - Cytoplasmic Proteins of Untreated Cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001416

Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients – proteins from serum samples of melanoma patients with high tumor load	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004624
Proteomics and metabolomics reveal changes in cancer cells after alternation of SHMT2 expressions	In order to understand the underline mechanism of SHMT2 (serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2) effect on tumor growth, proteome and metabolome analysis were carried on a engineered HeLa cell line (HeLa-SHMT2-shSHMT2, short as HeLa-Ss), which has inducible SHMT2 over-expression or suppression by treating cell with tetracycline or IPTG, respectively.  SHMT2 over-expression in HeLa-ss cell increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, deceased expression of several mitochondrial complex I and III proteins, and increased glycine and glutathione levels in cells.  BioID method identified more than 20 SHMT2 associated proteins that are involved in oxidation-reduction process.  These results indicate SHMT2 involves in the regulation of cellular redox balance. SHMT2 repression only reduced growth of cells under glycine depletion condition. It increased expression of several proteins involved in glutaminolysis and amino acid transporters, and elevated metabolites related to glutamine metabolism.  These results indicate tumor cells have a compensatory reaction after SHMT2 suppression.  Further reducing glycine levels in cells by sodium benzoate caused cell death in cultured cell and slightly reduced tumor growth in vivo.  Benzoate treatment induces more changes in protein expressions and metabolite levels and may be a new approach to inhibit tumor growth.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004954
Comparative endometrial proteomics among fertile women, intrauterine device carriers, and recurrent implantation failure patients using iTRAQ methodology	Endometrial receptivity is imperative to achieving pregnancy in humans. A disruption in the development of endometrial receptivity is responsible for recurrent implantation failures (RIF) of endometrial origin. To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind the endometrial receptivity process, we used the 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method to compare and quantify the proteomes from endometrial biopsies of three different endometrial statuses (fertile women, IUD carriers and RIF patients). Overall, iTRAQ allowed to identify 1,889 non-redundant proteins. Of these, 188 were differentially expressed proteins (DEP) (p-value < 0.05) among the three endometrial groups. Pairwise comparisons revealed 133 significant DEP in fertile vs. IUD carriers and 158 DEP in RIF vs. IUD carriers. However, no DEP were identified between fertile and RIF patients. Western blot validation of three DEP involved in endometrial receptivity (Plastin 2, Lactotrasferrin, and Lysozyme) confirmed our iTRAQ results. Moreover, functional KEGG enrichment revealed that complement and coagulation cascades and peroxisome were the two most significant pathways for the RIF vs. IUD comparison and ribosome and spliceosome for the fertile vs. IUD comparison, as possible important pathways involved in the endometrial receptivity acquisition. Our findings confirm that an IUD introduces numerous changes in the endometrial protein profile when compared to fertile and RIF endometria, revealing some key proteins involved in endometrial receptivity. The lack of DEP between fertile and RIF patient endometria suggest either that idiopathic RIF may not have an endometrial origin, with other as-yet-unknown factors involved.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011094
Direct evidence of milk consumption from ancient human dental calculus, St Helena	This study investigated the consumption of milk products in the archaeological record, utilizing human dental calculus as a reservoir of dietary proteins from archaeological samples from across Eurasia.

BCL2 amplicon loss and super-enhancer remodeling drives ABT-199 resistance	Drug-tolerant “persister” tumor cells underlie the emergence of drug-resistant clones contribute to relapse and disease progression; thus, identifying actionable targets that disable persisters and mitigate relapse are a high priority need. Although the BCL2-targeting agent venetoclax (ABT-199) has shown promising responses in mantle cell and double hit B cell lymphomas, resistance often arises, yet mechanistically how this occurs is unclear. Here we report that ABT-199 resistance can evolve from persister clones that have selective deletions  at 18q21 that involve the drug target BCL2 and the apoptotic regulators Noxa (PMAIP1) and TCF4. Notably, reprogramming of super enhancers (SE) in persisters contributes to resistance, where there is a selection for SE-directed overexpression of the apoptotic regulator BCL2A1 and oncogenic transcription factors IKZF1 and FOXC1. At the same time, the SE reprogramming confers an opportunity for overcoming ABT-199 resistance.  An unbiased drug screen on a platform that recapitulates the lymphoma microenvironment revealed that persisters are vulnerable to inhibitors of transcription initiation and elongation, and especially so to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that is essential for transcription initiation. Specifically, CDK7 loss or inhibition eliminated the persister phenotype by disabling SE-driven expression of BCL2A1, IKZF1 and FOXC1.  Thus, the co-treatment of ABT-199 with CDK7 inhibitors blocked the evolution of drug resistance, and provoked tumor regression in models of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and double hit lymphomas (DHL) that overexpress both MYC and BCL2. Together, these findings establish loss of apoptotic regulators and an adaptive transcriptional response as drug resistance mechanisms in lymphoma, more importantly, establish a rationale for transcription inhibition-based combination strategies to prevent and overcome drug resistance in B cell malignancies toward BCL2 inhibitor.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010193

Proteomic analysis of urinary microvesicles reveal biomarkers for neurologic disease	Background- Extracellular vesicles (EVs) harbor thousands of proteins that hold promise for biomarker development. Usually difficult to purify, EVs in urine are relatively easily obtained and have demonstrated efficacy for kidney disease prediction. Herein, we further characterize the proteome of urinary EVs to explore the potential for biomarkers unrelated to kidney dysfunction, focusing on Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods- Using a quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we measured urinary EV proteins from a discovery cohort of 50 subjects. EVs in urine were classified into subgroups and EV proteins were ranked by abundance and variability over time. Enriched pathways and ontologies in stable EV proteins were identified and proteins that predict PD were further measured in a cohort of 108 subjects.  Findings- Hundreds of commonly expressed urinary EV proteins with stable expression over time were distinguished from proteins expressed in few individual with high variability over time.  Bioinformatic analyses reveal a striking enrichment of endolysosomal proteins linked to Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s disease, and other neurologic disorders. Tissue and biofluid enrichment analyses show broad representation of EVs from across the body without bias towards kidney or urine proteins. Among the proteins linked to neurological diseases, SNAP23 and calbindin were the most elevated in PD cases with 86% prediction success for disease diagnosis in the discovery cohort and 76% prediction success in the replication cohort.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013710

Transcriptomic and Proteomic Response of HC-04 to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)	The routine study of human malaria liver-stage biology in vitro is hampered by low infection efficiency of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lines (<0.1%), poor understanding of steady-state HCC biology, and lack of appropriate tools for trace sample analysis. HC-04 is the only HCC that supports complete development of human malaria parasites. We hypothesized that HCCs are in various intermediate stages of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HC-04s retain epithelial characteristics that permit infection. We developed an novel analytical approach to test this hypothesis viz. the HC-04 response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We used online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to quantify protein expression profiles in HC-04 pre-/post-HGF treatment and validated these results by RT-qPCR and microscopy. We successfully increased protein identification efficiency over offline-2D methods by 12-fold using less sample material, allowing robust protein quantification. We observed expected up-regulation and down-regulation of EMT protein markers in response to HGF, but also unexpected cellular responses. HC-04 is thus susceptible to HGF-mediated signaling but to a lesser degree than what we observed for HepG2, a widely used, but poor malaria HCC model.  Our analytical approach to understanding the basic biology of HC-04 helps us understand the factors that may influence its utility as a model for malaria liver-stage development. We observed that HC-04 treatment with HGF prior to the addition of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites did not facilitate cell invasion, arguing for unlinking the effect of HGF on malaria liver stage development from hepatocyte invasion. Finally, our 2D-LC-MS/MS approach and broadly applicable experimental strategy should prove useful in the analysis of various hepatocyte-pathogen interactions, tumor progression and early disease events.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000682
Proteomics identifies markers of MAPKi resistance offering new therapeutic strategies in melanoma- Cytoplasmic (cyt), nuclear (ne) and secreted (sn) proteins of MAPKi sensitive melanoma cells	MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) show outstanding clinical response rates in melanoma patients harbouring BRAF mutations, but resistance is common. High-throughput, subcellular proteome analyses at two different MS laboratories and RNA-seq on two panels of primary melanoma cells that were either sensitive or MAPKi resistant, revealed that only fifteen proteins were sufficient to discriminate between resistant and sensitive cells. The two proteins with the highest discriminatory power were PTRF and IGFBP7, both highly upregulated in the resistant cells. They were associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and are mechanistically linked. Knock-out of PTRF revealed targets involved in lysosomal activation, endocytosis, pH regulation, EMT, TGFbeta signalling and cell migration and adhesion. In addition, immunohistochemistry on patient samples showed that PTRF and IGFBP7 expression levels were significant biomarkers of poor progression free survival under MAPKi treatment. A drug screen of MAPKi resistant cells using a 960-compound kinase modulator library identified two lead compounds that were effective in targeting MAPKi resistant cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005432

Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - nuclear proteins of dexamethasone-treated inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001421
CHPP chr 1,8,20 proteome dataset using the HCC cell lines of Hep3B and MHCC97H, instrument is AB5600, part 3 of 3	The fresh cells as described above were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 8 M Urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3 and 5 mM IAA. The total cell lysates were centrifuged with 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 degrees Celsius to remove cell debris, and 1.5 mg proteins for each cell line were followed by sequential in-solution protein digestion by Lys-C and trypsin at 37 degrees Celsius respectively. The tryptic peptides were cleaned by C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters UK Ltd, Manchester, UK). The mass spectrometer used in this dataset was Triple TOF 5600 (AB SCIEX, Concord, ON). The dataset was produced with two technical replicates and 24 fractions per repeat. The database searching procedure was achieved using Mascot v2.3.

Human cerebrospinal fluid exosome, LC-MSMS	Quantitative proteomics analysis of exosomes isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of neuromyelitis optica patients detected potential distinctive disease markers capable of differentiating from multiple sclerosis and idiopathic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.  Exosomes were enriched with high purity using differential centrifugation from pooled cerebrospinal fluids.  The sample pooling strategy included pre-classification by cytokine level, which improved target molecule identification by providing enhanced fold change ratios and lower p-values when the subsets with high-cytokines were compared to each other.  In addition to the spectral counts and label-free quantification, orthogonal quantitative validation was performed using tandem mass spectrometry analysis via UPLC and Orbitrap or Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrumentation.  The proteomic datasets with 442 significant exosomal proteins detected putative disease specific biomarkers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and fibronectin for neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis, respectively.  Additional investigation of expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein and fibronectin revealed their presence in intact exosomes as detected by flow cytometry.  ELISA measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein within individual samples demonstrated diagnostic applicability by appropriately clustering disease groups.  Expression levels of target molecules from label-free quantification were in good agreement with those from Western blotting.  Finally, MetaCore pathway analysis of identified proteins supported the involvement of these proteins in disease progression via neurological pathway involvement.  This comprehensive study suggests that the exosomal proteomics approach of cerebrospinal fluid can be applied to the identification and characterization of inflammatory disorders in central nervous system.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002424

Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients - proteins from serum samples of healthy donors	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004626
HCC progression -  Quantitative proteome analysis reveals the correlation between endocytosis-associated proteins and hepatocellular carcinoma dedifferentiation	Endocytosis is a cellular function which is likely to take part in HCC development due to its important role in regulating the abundances of vital signaling receptors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of endocytosis-associated proteins in HCCs with various differentiation grades. Therefore, we analyzed 36 tissue specimens from HCC patients via label-free LC-MS/MS including 19 HCC tissue samples with different degrees of histological grades and 17 corresponding non-tumorous tissue controls.  Following label-free analysis the abundances of SCAMP3 and CLTC were immunohistochemically examined in tissue sections of 84 HCC patients. We demonstrate the novel association of several endocytosis-associated proteins, in particular SCAMP3 with HCC progression.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003552
Label-free proteomics reveal that plasma protein expression differs between colorectal cancer patients according to tumor stage, location, patient survival, preoperative radiotherapy status, or gender.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and is a heterogeneous disease, with differences between cancer in the right colon, left colon, and rectum. In this study, plasma samples from CRC patients with varying stage (II or III), primary tumor location (right colon, left colon, or rectum) and survival (survived or died due to CRC) were studied with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MSE. Patients were also divided into subgroups based on preoperative radiotherapy status and gender. Further analysis subsequently identified multiple plasma proteins whose expression differed depending on tumor stage, location, patient survival, preoperative radiotherapy status, or gender.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013150
Validation of a novel shotgun proteomic workflow for the discovery of protein-protein interactions: focus on ZNF521	The study of protein-protein interactions is increasingly relying on mass spectrometry (MS). The classical approach of separating immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion is long and labour-intensive. Besides, it is difficult to integrate it with most quantitative MS-based workflows, except for stable isotopic labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This work describes a fast, flexible and quantitative workflow for the discovery of novel proteinprotein interactions. A cleavable cross-linker, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP), is utilized to stabilize protein complexes before immunoprecipitation. Protein complex detachment from the antibody is achieved by limited proteolysis. Finally, protein quantitation is performed via 18O labelling. The workflow has been optimized concerning: (i) DSP concentration and (ii) incubation times for limited proteolysis, using the stem cell-associated transcription co-factor ZNF521 as a model target. The interaction of ZNF521 with the core components of the nuclear remodelling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, already reported in the literature, was confirmed. Additionally, interactions with newly discovered molecular partners of potentially relevant functional role, such as ZNF423, Spt16, Spt5, were discovered and validated by Western blotting.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001609

Phosphorylation ratio determination in fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue with targeted mass spectrometry	Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues are routinely prepared and collected for diagnostics in pathology departments. Therefore, FFPE tissues are the most accessible research sources in pathology archives. In this study we investigated whether we can apply a targeted and quantitative parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method for FFPE tissue samples in a sensitive and reproducible way. Normal brain and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues were used to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Two analytical methods (or workflows) were used: PRM measurement of a tryptic digest without phosphopeptide enrichment (Direct-PRM) and after Fe-NTA phosphopeptide enrichment (Fe-NTA-PRM). Applying these two methods, the phosphorylation ratio could be determined for selected four peptide pairs that originate from Neuroblast differentiation-associated protein (AHNAK S5448-p), Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit delta (CAMK2D T337-p), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B S93-p) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR S1166-p). In normal brain FFPE tissues, using the Fe-NTA-PRM method, we were able to quantify the targeted phosphorylated peptides with a high degree of reproducibility (CV = 14%). Our results indicate that formalin fixation does not impede relative quantification of a phosphosite and its phosphorylation ratio in FFPE tissues. The developed methods open ways to study archival FFPE tissues.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017943

Comparative proteomics of non-nodular and nodular skin tissues from a Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome patient.	Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene CMG2. Patients develop subcutaneous nodules and painful joint contracture. CMG2 is a transmembrane protein of poorly understood physiological function. To understand better the pathogenesis of HFS and the role of CMG2 in this disease, we compared by mass-spectrometry the composition of nodular and matching non-nodular tissues. Two tissue pairs were analyzed, both obtained after surgical resection of nodules from a HFS patient. Our shotgun proteomics analysis showed that nodules were enriched in serum protein, which correlated with previous descriptions of blood vessel leakage in these tissues. Importantly, we also observed a clear accumulation of collagen VI in nodules. Collagen VI accumulation was caused by CMG2 loss-of-function and is the main cause of the nodule formation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006268
2018CHPP -  Digging for Missing Proteins Using Low-Molecular-Weight Protein Enrichment and a "Mirror Protease" Strategy	ABSTRACT Since 2012, Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) launched the journey of missing proteins (MPs) investigation for completing human proteome project (HPP). We found the majority of MPs were distributed in low molecular weight (LMW) ranges, especially in 0-40 kDa. The identification of LMW proteins is challenging owing to their low length, low abundancy, and hydrophobicity. Even worse, many sequences from Trypsin digestion are unlikely to yield detectable peptides or composed less number of observable peptides in MS detection. Therefore, we focused on small MPs by combining LMW protein enrichment and mirror-protease strategy on human testis samples. The in-depth testis LMW protein profiling documented 4,063 proteins from which 2,565 proteins were belong to LMW proteins and 1,130 proteins had mirror peptides. This provided mass spectral evidence for small MPs further verification, and two MPs were verified in seven identified MPs. For Q8N688, confident peptides were verified from Trypsin and LysargiNase digestions, and continuous b/y-ion peptide was obtained by mirror-spectrum matching. Two verified peptides of Q86WR6 were from gel-separation and gel-elution dataset, respectively. And the other 5 MPs cannot be distinguished sufficiently as PE1, but need more verification information.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD010093

The impact of oncogenic EGFRvIII on the proteome of extracellular vesicles (exosomes) released from glioblastoma cells	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of primary brain tumors, driven by a complex repertoire of oncogenic alterations, including the constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII). EGFRvIII impacts both cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous aspects of GBM progression, including cell invasion, angiogenesis and modulation of the tumor microenvoiront, this is, at least in part, attributable to the release and intercellular trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous membrane structures containing multiple bioactive macromolecules. Here we analyzed the impact of EGFRvIII on the profile of glioma EVs using a series of isogenic tumor cell lines, in which this oncogene exhibits a strong transforming activity. Thus, we observed that EGFRvIII expression alters several properties of glioma EVs, including their output and global protein composition. Using mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomic analysis and Gene Ontology terms filters, we observed that EVs released by EGFRVIII-transformed cells were enriched for extracellular exosome and focal adhesion related proteins. Among them, we validated the association of pro-invasive proteins (CD44, BSG, CD151) with EVs of EGFRvIII expressing cells, and down-regulation of exosomal markers (CD81 and CD82) in EVs of their indolent counterparts. Nano-flow cytometry revealed that the EV output from individual glioma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, such that only a fraction of EVs contained specific proteins such as EGFR, CD9, or others. Notably, cells expressing EGFRvIII released ample EVs double positive for CD44/BSG, and these proteins also co-localized in cellular filopodia. We also detected the expression of homophilic adhesion molecules and increased homologous EV uptake by EGFRvIII-positive glioma cells. These results suggest that oncogenic EGFRvIII reprograms the proteome of GBM-related EVs, a notion with considerable implications for their biological activity and properties relevant for development of EV-based cancer biomarkers.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008311
Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - bulk tumor tissue	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001326
HDAC inhibition enhances the in vivo efficacy of MEK inhibitor therapy in uveal melanoma	Purpose: The clinical use of MEK inhibitors in uveal melanoma is limited by the rapid acquisition of resistance. The current study has used multi-omics approaches and drug screens to identify the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat as an effective strategy to limit MEK inhibitor resistance. Experimental Design: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq was used to identify the signaling pathways involved in the escape of uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibitor therapy. Mechanistic studies were performed to evaluate the escape pathways identified and the efficacy of the MEK-HDAC inhibitor combination was demonstrated in multiple in vivo xenograft models of uveal melanoma. Results: We identified a number of putative escape pathways that were upregulated following MEK inhibition including the PI3K/AKT pathway, ROR1/2 and IGF1R signaling. MEK inhibition was also associated with a widespread increase in GPCR expression, particularly the Endothelin B receptor and that this contributed to therapeutic escape through YAP signaling. A screen of 289 clinical grade compounds identified HDAC inhibitors as potential candidates that suppressed the adaptive YAP and AKT signaling that followed MEK inhibition. In vivo xenograft studies revealed the MEK-HDAC inhibitor combination to outperform either agent alone, leading to a long-term decrease of tumor growth and the suppression of adaptive PI3K/AKT and YAP signaling. Conclusions Together our studies have identified GPCR-mediated YAP activation and RTK-driven AKT signaling as key pathways involved in the escape of uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibition. We further demonstrate that HDAC inhibition is a promising combination partner for MEK inhibitors in uveal melanoma.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013988

Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - cytoplasmic proteins of inflammatory stimulated fibroblasts	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003413

Proteomic Analysis of Human Liver Reference Material	Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) instruments resulting in high mass resolution and high duty cycles have allowed of very deep coverage of proteomes. However, even with state of the art, high duty cycle instruments, the number of proteins identified with a conventional single liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC/MS/MS) analysis is typically limited and fractionating protein samples prior to LC/MS/MS analysis is crucial for increasing both the analytical dynamic range and proteome coverage.  In order to achieve near comprehensive identification of proteomes two-dimensional (2D) chromatography has been an invaluable tool.  This first dimension is typically performed with µL/min flow and relatively large column inner diameters, which allow efficient pre-fractionation but typically require peptide amounts in the milligram range while the second dimension is typically performed with nL/min flow rates and capillary columns with small inner diameters. Typically, reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) provides high peak resolution of peptides and achieves higher peak capacities than strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) due to the faster chromatographic partitioning. Another advantage of RPLC is that the mobile phases used generate much cleaner samples for downstream analyses, while the incorporation of a desalting step for SCX in order to eliminated the high salt concentrations that can significantly decrease the analytical sensitivity of the MS analysis due to ionization problems. When operated at widely different pH values (e.g., 1st dimension pH 10 and 2nd dimension pH 3) 2D RPLC-RPLC provides separation orthogonality comparable to that of the combination of SCX-RPLC. The difference of separation selectivity between the low and high pH (HpH) RPLC comes from the changes in the charge distribution within peptide chains upon altering pH of the eluent.  Herein we describe a method in which tryptic peptides are separated in the first dimension by HpH-RPLC and fractions are collected every 90 s over an 80 min gradient. For the second dimension, each of these fractions is individually run by the standard low pH RPLC method. The implementation of the HpH pre-fractionation allows for short second dimension gradients for bottom up LC/MS/MS and yields very deep (e.g. thousands of identifications) protein coverage at reasonable measurement time.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009021
Proteomics-based insights into mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor resistance of cerebral melanoma metastases	Background MAP kinase inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy for BRAF mutated melanoma is characterized by high response rates but also development of drug resistance within a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9 to 12 months. Understanding mechanisms of resistance and identifying effective therapeutic alternatives is one of the most important scientific challenges in melanoma. Using proteomics, we want to specifically gain insight into the pathophysiological process of cerebral metastases. Methods Cerebral metastases from melanoma patients were prepared for MS analysis by tryptic digestion. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a QExactive HF hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a nanospray ion source, coupled with a nano HPLC system.  Results In this pilot study, we were able to identify 5,977 proteins by LC-MS analysis. Samples were classified into good and poor responders based on PFS. By evaluating these proteomic profiles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we could characterize differences between the two distinct groups. We further detected an EMT signature, V-type proton ATPases, calcium ion binding proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factors, cell adhesion proteins and several transporter and exchanger proteins to be significantly up-regulated in poor responding patients, whereas good responders showed an immune-activation and involvement of extracellular matrix structural constituents, among other features. Subsequently we identified the most class-discriminating proteins based on nearest shrunken centroids. Conclusions Using proteomics helped to identify already known extra-cerebral resistance mechanisms in the cerebral metastases and further discovered possible brain specific mechanisms of drug efflux, which might serve as interesting targets, especially for treatment of these types of metastases or as predictive marker.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007592
Epigenetic inactivation of the autophagy-lysosomal system in the Parkinson’s disease appendix	The gastrointestinal tract may be a site of origin for α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), and an abundance of aggregated α-syn has recently been demonstrated in both the healthy and PD appendix. However, the molecular changes that enable gut α-syn aggregates to contribute to the development and progression of PD remain unclear. Here, our deep-sequencing of DNA methylation changes at 521 autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) genes in the human appendix and brain in PD and healthy controls indicates a pattern of widespread hypermethylation in the PD appendix that is recapitulated in the PD brain. There is significant overlap in the individual ALP genes affected across the PD appendix and brain, with lysosomal genes specifically downregulated in both regions. Healthy epigenetic aging, which involves a hypermethylation of macroautophagy and selective autophagy genes in the appendix and brain, is disrupted in both areas in PD. In mice, DNA methylation changes at ALP genes induced by chronic gut inflammation are greatly exacerbated by the presence of α-syn pathology. DNA methylation changes at ALP genes induced by α-synucleinopathy are significantly associated with the ALP abnormalities observed in the PD appendix, specifically involving lysosomal genes. Our work, which constitutes an in-depth, unbiased investigation of epigenetic changes in the ALP of the PD gut and brain, identifies the epigenetic misregulation of the ALP, especially a downregulation of lysosomal genes, as a potential culprit for the initiation and spread of α-syn pathology in idiopathic PD.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015079

Gingipain transpeptidation -  Porphyromonas gingivalis Gingipains Display Transpeptidation Activity	Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontal pathogen that has been associated with autoimmune disorders. The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human haemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis while the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human haemoglobin. All haemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation and this transpeptidation enhanced haemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, haemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilised as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest haemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction suggesting that gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo. The transpeptidation of host proteins in vivo may potentially lead to the breakdown of immunological tolerance culminating in autoimmune reactions.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009950
Immunohistochemical markers distinguishing cholangiocellular carcinoma from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma discovered by proteomic analysis of microdissected cells	Cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are two highly aggressive cancer types which arise from epithelial cells of the pancreatobiliary system. Due to their histologic and morphologic similarity, differential diagnosis between CCC and metastasis of PDAC located in the liver frequently proves an unsolvable issue for pathologists. Biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity for the differentiation of these tumour types would therefore be a valuable tool, but so far none are available. Here, we address this problem by comparing microdissected CCC and PDAC tumour cells in a label-free proteomics approach. The novel biomarker candidates were subsequently verified by immunohistochemical staining of primary and secondary tumour tissue.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001833
Nitration of Tyrosines In Complement Factor H Domains Alters Its Immunological Activity and Mediates A Pathogenic Role In Age Related Macular Degeneration	Nitrosative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Tyrosine nitration is a unique type of post translational modification that occurs in the setting of inflammation and nitrosative stress. To date, the significance and functional implications of tyrosine nitration of complement factor H (CFH), a key complement regulator in the eye has not been explored, and is examined in this study in the context of AMD pathogenesis. Sections of eyes from deceased individuals with AMD (n = 5) demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive nitrotyrosine CFH. We purified nitrated CFH from retinae from 2 AMD patients. Mass spectrometry of CFH isolated from AMD eyes revealed residues in domains critical for binding to heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipid peroxidation by-products and complement (C) 3b were nitrated. Functional studies revealed that nitrated CFH did not bind to lipid peroxidation products, nor to the GAG of perlecan nor to C3b. There was loss of cofactor activity for Factor I mediated cleavage of C3b with nitrated CFH compared to non-nitrated CFH. CFH inhibits, but nitrated CFH significantly potentiates, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokine IL-8 from monocytes that have been stimulated with lipid peroxidation by-products. AMD patients (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) were used to measure plasma nitrated CFH using a novel ELISA. AMD patients had significantly elevated nitrated CFH levels compared to controls (p = 0.0117). These findings strongly suggest that nitrated CFH contributes to AMD progression, and is a target for therapeutic intervention.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005613
Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - secreted proteins of untreated fibroblasts	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD003416

A Mass Spectrometry Approach Reveals a New Toxic Role For Alzheimer’s Disease Aβ Peptide: SPLICEOSOME IMPAIRMENT	Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, and its prevalence increases exponentially with age. The patients affected gradually lose cognitive function, control over their sense of orientation, their emotions, and other aspects of behavior. Thirty-five million people are now considered to be affected by AD and this number is expected to double in the next few decades. We utilized an AD cell model system for a proteomic study by using mass spectrometry. To mimic early events in AD, LAN5 neuroblastoma cell were incubated for a short time with a recombinant form of Aβ42 (rAβ42), a peptide involved in AD, and the extracted proteins were utilized for the proteome analysis. Furthermore, we used bioinformatics tools to identify networks, associated processes, pathways, etc. The potential modulation of pathways suggested by the similarity of GO terms and presence of protein-protein interaction networks among significantly modulated proteins was explored using the bioinformatic tool KEGG. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for up and down regulated protein groups, and four pathways were identified. In particular, the Spliceosome pathway identified in the under-expressed protein group was reported by KEGG to be the most significantly enriched. To confirm the effect of Aβ42 on the spliceosomal pathway, the level of expression of SmB/B’/N (a component of the spliceosomal machinery) was measured. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the the down-regulation effect of the spliceosome proteins in AD, and how this may contribute to the early event in this disorder.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD002842
Comparison of different sample preparation protocols reveals lysis buffer specific extraction biases in gram-negative bacteria and human cells	We evaluated different in-solution and FASP-based sample preparation strategies for absolute protein quantification. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was employed to compare different sample preparation strategies in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) and noted organismal specific differences in general performance and enrichment of specific protein classes. The original FASP protocol globally enriched for most proteins on the bacterial sample whereas the Sodium deoxycholate in-solution strategy was more efficient on HEK cells. Although detergents were found highly suited for global proteome analysis higher intensities were obtained for high abundant nucleic acid associated protein complexes, like the ribosome and histone proteins using guanidine hydrochloride. Importantly, we show for the first time that the observable total proteome mass of a sample strongly depends on the sample preparation protocol with some protocols resulting in significant underestimation of protein mass due to incomplete protein extraction of biased protein groups	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001511
Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients - proteins from serum samples of melanoma patients with low tumor load	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD004625

Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - cytoplasmic proteins of young B cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006572
Proteomics identifies markers of MAPKi resistance offering new therapeutic strategies in melanoma- Cytoplasmic (cyt), nuclear (ne) and secreted (sn) proteins of BRAFi resistant melanoma cells	MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) show outstanding clinical response rates in melanoma patients harbouring BRAF mutations, but resistance is common. High-throughput, subcellular proteome analyses at two different MS laboratories and RNA-seq on two panels of primary melanoma cells that were either sensitive or MAPKi resistant, revealed that only fifteen proteins were sufficient to discriminate between resistant and sensitive cells. The two proteins with the highest discriminatory power were PTRF and IGFBP7, both highly upregulated in the resistant cells. They were associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and are mechanistically linked. Knock-out of PTRF revealed targets involved in lysosomal activation, endocytosis, pH regulation, EMT, TGFbeta signalling and cell migration and adhesion. In addition, immunohistochemistry on patient samples showed that PTRF and IGFBP7 expression levels were significant biomarkers of poor progression free survival under MAPKi treatment. A drug screen of MAPKi resistant cells using a 960-compound kinase modulator library identified two lead compounds that were effective in targeting MAPKi resistant cells.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005433
Proteomics identifies new therapeutic targets of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers, the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Although HCC surgical treatment may be curative in the early stages, its five-year overall survival is only 50-70%. Advances in proteomic technologies have expanded the breadth and depth of cancer proteome characterization. Here, we present the largest characterization effort on proteomic profiling of 222 tumor and paired non-tumor tissues in clinically early HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 and A). Quantitative proteomic data identified three more-refined subtypes in the early- stage cohort of HCC (termed S-I, S-II and S-III) with different clinical outcomes. S-I retained hepatic detoxification and metabolic functions with the best prognosis, S-II increased molecular expression related to proliferation, and S-III showed distinct enrichment of tumor metastasis and immune response pathways and the poorest prognosis. The subtype specific signatures targeted by known FDA approved drugs or inhibitors under clinical investigations for HCC provide a novel resource for HCC therapeutic targets. A new mechanism of disrupted cholesterol homeostasis with aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl esters was also highlighted in S-III. Thus, this study represents the first proteomic stratification of early-stage HCC, providing insights into tumor biology and personalized targeted therapy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006512
